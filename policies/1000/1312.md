## 1312 - Public Complaints

Board members shall refer persons making complaints about the schools to the most immediate level at which the problems can be resolved and, thence, as may be necessary, through lines of organization to the Superintendent of Schools. Parents should be made aware of the proper channels of communication and appeal. The decision of the Principal regarding a student must include the next step of appeal. Any appeal from the decision of the Superintendent to the Board shall be in writing and signed.

### Challenged Material

A procedure for processing and responding to criticism of approved materials shall be established and followed. This procedure shall include a formal, signed complaint of standard format and an appointed committee to re-evaluate the material in question.

In all cases, the decision to retain or reject shall be made on the basis of whether the material presents life in its true proportions, whether circumstances are realistically dealt with, and whether the material has literary or social value. Factual material shall be included in all instructional material collections.

### Public Complaints

If it appears necessary, the Superintendent, the person who made the complaint, or the employee involved may request a session of the Board of Education for the purpose of fuller study and a decision by this body.  Generally, all parties involved, including the school administration, shall be asked to attend such a meeting for the purpose of presenting additional facts, making further explanations, and clarifying the issues. Hearsay and rumor shall be discounted as well as emotional feeling except those directly related to the facts of the situation.

The Board shall conduct such meetings in as fair and just a manner as possible.  The Board may request a disinterested third party to act as a mediator to help it reach a mutually satisfactory solution.  After the Board's decision, the usual appeal route pertains.

Any parent, guardian, or other person who upbraids, insults, or abuses any teacher or other employee on school property or in the presence of students may be prosecuted by the district under the provisions of law.  School employees who are sued as a consequence of performing their assigned duties shall be provided full legal services.

### Request for Re-Evaluation of Instructional Materials

The following procedure shall be followed whenever there is a request for the evaluation of print and non-print material other than textbooks:

1.  The Superintendent shall establish an ad hoc review committee broadly representative of:

  a.  Teachers competent in the area of the content covered by the print or non-print material.

  b.  Administrators, directors, and supervisors appropriate to the level and/or subject for which material is used.

A media specialist shall serve on the review committee.

2.  Objections to materials and requests for re-evaluation must be presented in writing on the proper form. "Citizenâ€™s Request for Reconsideration of a Book" forms are obtainable in the office of the Superintendent

3.  Initial action on a written request on the proper form shall be taken no later than fifteen school days after receipt of the request.

4.  A written report from the review committee shall be submitted to the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall then communicate his or her decision to the person requesting the re-evaluation.

5.  Should the decision of the Superintendent not satisfy the person requesting the re-evaluation, the Board of Education may review the Superintendent's decision.

6.  Once instructional material has been adopted and re-evaluated the material cannot be subject to further review without special approval by the Board of Education.  Challenged instructional materials shall remain in use in the schools pending final decision.
