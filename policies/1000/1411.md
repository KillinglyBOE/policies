## 1411 - Law Enforcement

### Law Enforcement Officials

Schools are responsible for students during school hours which includes protecting each student's constitutional rights, assuring due process in  questioning and arrest, and protecting students from any form of illegal coercion.

When police are investigating  possible criminal acts which occurred, or may have occurred, on school property, or while under the jurisdiction of the school district, they may question students at school when the following procedures are observed:

1. Students will be questioned as confidentially and inconspicuously as possible.

2. An attempt will be made to notify the student's parents so that they may be present during the questioning.  The school principal, or his\/her designee, will be present.

3. Preferably, the officer doing the questioning will wear civilian clothes.


Because of the many support services which local law enforcement agencies provide to the schools, staff, and students, the Board of Education supports the best possible relationship with those agencies consistent with district responsibilities to protect legal rights of staff and students.

The Superintendent of Schools is directed to establish lines of communication with local law enforcement agencies to effect necessary cooperation toward ensuring the security of the school facilities, the safety of students and staff, and for better student education about law enforcement agencies.

### Relations With Law Enforcement Agencies

#### School - Police Cooperation

This regulation is intended to balance the needs of school and police officials.  The reduction of ambiguity and confusion in how these officials interact will provide an optimal environment for education while ensuring that the public safety needs of the school and community are adequately met.

Generally, police should be notified immediately of any crime. Police will make every attempt to minimize distractions or disruption of school routines during the performance of their duties. There may be instances where the transgression is so slight that the school administrator can resolve the issue himself\/herself. Examples of crimes that fall into this category are theft of pocket change, minor vandalism, or minor physical altercations in which there is no injury or pain inflicted upon either participant.

| Event | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- |
| Vandalism, Breaking, Entering, etc. | Police should be notified immediately. \(cf. 5131.5 - Vandalism\) |
| Alcohol, Drugs, etc. | The suspected drug or alcohol should be secured by the building administrator and given directly to the responding police officer. The police officer will sign a receipt and give it to the building administrator. Prescription drugs out of the container should be seized and the prescription confirmed via the subscribing doctor. If the prescription is not valid the drug should be seized and the police notified. \(cf. 5131.6 - Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco\) |
| Loitering | As long as the school grounds are posted, "no trespassing", warnings prior to arrest are not required. Notification of police and requests for arrest are within the discretion of the building administrator. |
| Confrontations | Confrontations where students become involved in loud tumultuous behavior but do not assault another is a violation of the law and police can arrest for this behavior. The decision to call police and request an arrest is within the discretion of the building administrator. |
| Assaults | Physical altercations in which students are injured or pain has been inflicted upon another should be reported to the police as soon as practicable. |
| Weapons | Confiscated weapons that are illegal in themselves should be turned over to the police department immediately by the school official who seized same. This category of weapons includes knives with over a four inch blade, dirk knives, switch blade knives, martial arts weapons and guns. Ammunition should also be immediately turned over to the police. Any evidence or information relative to firearms in the school should be immediately relayed to the police. Weapons that are not illegal in themselves but are a violation of school policy. Police notification in these instances are within the discretion of the school administrator. \(cf. 5131.7 - Weapons and Dangerous Instruments\) |
| Bomb Scare Suspect Devices | Do not handle suspected devices. Notify Superintendent's office and police. Police will notify the Fire Department. A building check will be completed by custodial staff. The building administrator will decide whether or not to evacuate following discussions with the police and fire officials. The administrator will notify the Superintendent of his\/her decision. |
| Civil Disobedience | When known about in advance, school and police should plan beforehand. Picketing is legal whereas blocking traffic, etc., is illegal. |
| Motor Vehicles, Parking Lots | Police routinely patrol parking lots and may arrest or summon individuals in said lots. Students involved in motor vehicle accidents in parking lots that result in personal injury or over $400.00 in damages are required to report same. \(cf. 5131.3 - Student Driving\/Parking\) |
| Police Interviews | Generally will not take place on school grounds.  However, if the police do indicate that an interview on school grounds is necessary, school authorities shall cooperate. |
| Police Interviews of Juveniles | When the interview involves a juvenile, the police will usually arrange to have a parent present. The exceptions to this rule are \(a\) if the student is being interviewed as a victim and\/or \(b\) if there is an overriding immediate public safety concern. If a student under the age of 16 is being interviewed by the police and the parent\/guardian cannot be present, the student may at his\/her request, have a member of the school staff present. |
| Child Abuse | School officials will notify the Department of Children and Families and the police of suspected child abuse cases. If staff members have reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been abused by a school employee, they must report the abuse to the Superintendent who will notify the DCF and police. \(cf. 5141.4 - Reporting of Child Abuse\/Neglect\) |
| Extracurricular Activities | Police assigned on site have communications if additional police resources are needed. Police officials assigned to extracurricular activities shall report to the school administrator to discuss appropriate monitoring procedures. |
| Arrest Warrants | There are times in which the police may decide to pick up a student due to the warrant being issued for his\/her arrest. Once notified of an outstanding Arrest Warrant for a student, the student should be escorted from class by school personnel and remain in a secured office until the police arrive. The arrested student will be removed from the school in a way that minimized embarrassment to the student and any disruption of the school routine. Because of the disruption, whenever possible, warrants will be served at places other than at school. |
| Search of Students | School officials may search students, book bags, lockers, desks, etc., using the established "reasonable suspicion" standard. In cases where a student is suspected of carrying a dangerous weapon and there is a safety issue inherent in the search process itself, the police should conduct the search after the student is secured in an office. \(cf. 5145.12 - Search and Seizure\) |

#### Notification of a Student's Arrest

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Act 94-221, whenever the Superintendent receives oral, or written notification from the local police department or state police that a student was arrested, he\/she shall maintain the written report in a secure location and the information in the report shall be maintained as confidential in accordance with Section 46b-124.
