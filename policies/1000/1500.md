## 1500 - Relations between Area, State, Regional & National Associations and the Schools

Membership in recognized associations such as the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education will be maintained by the schools for several reasons, including

1.  The in-service education benefits to our staff and Board of Education which come from participation in meetings, conferences, clinics and conventions.

2.  Access to the communication media of such associations, such as newsletters, periodicals and advisory services.

3.  Representation in legislative and other actions affecting education generally and our school system in particular.

The Board of Education in maintaining such membership in no way abdicates its authority over the responsibility for the schools of the system as outlined in state law and Board of Education policy.

The Superintendent of Schools is authorized to budget funds for such memberships, and for paying the costs of adequate participation of Board of Education, administration and staff in the activities of such associations to achieve the purposes listed above.
