## 2210 - Administrative Leeway in Absence of Board of Education Policy

In cases where emergency action must be taken within the school system and where the Board of Education has provided no guides for administrative action, the Superintendent shall have the power to act, but the Superintendentâ€™s decisions shall be subject to review by action of the Board of Education at its next regular meeting.  It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to inform the Board of Education promptly of such action and of the need for possible additional policies or revision of existing policies.

**Policy adopted:  April 7, 1999**
