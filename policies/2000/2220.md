## 2220 - Representative and Deliberative Groups

The Board of Education encourages the Superintendent and administrative staff to create and maintain appropriate mechanisms such as councils, cabinets and committees to:

1.  Foster good communications within the staff.

2.  Allow each member of the staff to have a voice in the development of policies and in the making of decisions affecting them.

3.  Establish reasonable and easily used avenues of communication for the public, the pupils and the school system staff.
