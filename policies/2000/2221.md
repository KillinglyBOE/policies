## 2221 - Administrative Councils and Committees

The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish such permanent or temporary councils and committees as the administration deems necessary for proper administration of Board policies and for the improvement of the total educational program.

All councils and committees created by the Superintendent shall be for the purpose of obtaining, to a maximum degree, the advice and counsel of personnel of the district and to aid in district communication.  Functioning in an advisory capacity, such groups may make recommendations for submission to the Board through the Superintendent.  However, such groups shall exercise no inherent authority.  Authority for establishing policy remains with the Board and authority for implementing policy remains with the Superintendent.

The membership, composition, and responsibilities of administrative councils and committees shall be defined by the Superintendent and may be changed at his/her discretion.
