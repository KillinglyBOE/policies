## 3240.1 - State Agency Placements for Special Education

### Costs and Revenues

Pursuant to Section 10-76d (e) (4), as amended, of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Town Council of Killingly and the Board of Education agrees to administer State grants for public agency placements of children requiring special education, herein after referred to as "agency placements," and tuition received from other school districts for "agency placements" as follows:

1.  The Board of Education budget shall contain a separate set of line item appropriations for costs associated with “agency placements.” During the budget process, the Superintendent of Schools shall determine the appropriation for agency placement with such calculation clearly identified in the Board of Education's budget submission.

2.  The budget for school revenue shall contain two separate accounts for revenues received as a result of "agency placements;" one account will represent revenue from State grants for costs associated with "agency placements," the second account will represent tuition received from school districts identified as responsible for the costs of “agency placements.” A revenue estimate related to "agency placements" shall be agreed upon by the Superintendent and the Town Manager. 

3.  To the extent, if any, that actual expenditures exceed the appropriation budgeted in accordance with paragraph 1 of this policy, funds in an equal amount received in accordance with paragraph 2 of this policy will be treated as a reduction of Board of Education expenditures in the agency placement account. All remaining receipts in the revenue accounts described in paragraph 2 of this policy, if any, will be treated as a General Fund revenue source.

4.  (a)  If actual expenditures in the Board's agency placement account do not exceed the budgeted appropriation, all funds received from the sources identified in paragraph 2 of this policy shall be treated as a General Fund revenue source.

  (b)   Further, if actual expenditures in the Board's agency placement account fall below the budgeted appropriation, the difference shall be returned to the General Fund as surplus at the end of the fiscal year unless otherwise agreed to by the Town Council. These returned funds when combined with "agency placements" revenues received, shall at least equal budgeted revenue for that purpose.

5.  To verify costs in excess of the budgeted appropriation in accordance with paragraph l of this policy, the Superintendent of Schools shall present to the Town’s Treasurer documentation of expenses incurred for “agency placements.”

Either party may cancel or propose an amendment to this policy for a subsequent fiscal year, upon written notice to the other party given at least four months prior to the beginning of that fiscal year.
