## 3510 - Operation and Maintenance of Plant

An effective educational program requires clean, healthful, safe, businesslike and attractive physical facilities.  The maintenance and custodial staff is charged with the responsibility of caring for and protecting these facilities.  In order to carry out an efficient maintenance program, the custodians must receive the cooperation of the students, the teachers and administrators.

Each custodian shall have a daily work schedule in order to accomplish his/her part of the overall task. He/she shall be given directions on how to perform the various duties assigned to him/her. The Supervisor of Maintenance must supervise and check to ensure that all custodians are doing their share of the work to the best of their ability.

The Board wishes to maintain a long-range plan of maintenance projects and to be informed annually, in advance of budget preparation, of progress made.
