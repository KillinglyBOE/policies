## 3514 - Use of Vehicles

Generally school vehicles are to be used for school district business only. No vehicle is to be lent to an employee or other person for private use.

Vehicles are not to be used to transport anyone other than employees and students (on school buses/vans) except as approved by the Superintendent or designee.

The use of school buses and vans will be permitted with the approval of the Superintendent or designee to the following types of organizations:

A.  Town of Killingly

B.  Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, youth athletic programs and similar non-profit youth activities serving the Town of Killingly

C.  Special Service District Activities (e.g. Fire Departments)

In emergency or other unusual situations the Board authorizes the Superintendent to make exceptions to the policy. The Superintendent shall notify the Board as soon as possible of all exceptions.

The Superintendent shall establish a fee for outside use of vehicles in order that such use shall not impact negatively on the general appropriations.

**Policy adopted:  June 10, 1999**
