## 3523.1 - Acquisition and Updating of Technology

### Technology Purchases

The Killingly Board encourages the use of technology for any Killingly District function where efficiency, reliability or student learning will be improved.

### New Programs - Philosophy

New technologies or new applications of technology within the District shall be implemented only after careful and thorough planning by the IT Department and administrative staff. Pilot projects shall be established and evaluated for effectiveness whenever possible prior to implementing a new technological program on a school-wide or District-wide level. District support shall be given only to those new technologies that substantially improve efficiency, reliability or learning beyond current or "traditional" practice.

Whenever resources are allocated for the purchase of new technological hardware or software, resources shall also be allocated for staff training and the necessary supplementary materials and documentation.

### Technology Hardware Replacement

Technology significantly impacts the classroom and the operation of Killingly’s schools. The Killingly School District's technology plan must address all technology-related operations. Primary attention shall be given to the integration of technology into the curriculum and instructional practices. The plan must also relate to the importance of technology in the administration and management of the schools.  Moreover, in the selection of new resources, the Killingly School District must review not only new and desirable technologies, but should also assess existing technologies to determine how they can be integrated with the new. The sophistication of integrated systems can be one of the major strengths of technology for schools.

Students must be technologically literate and acquire skills and knowledge that allow them to function as productive citizens in a technologically-oriented society. To support this goal, hardware purchase and replacement is one of the components requiring attention in an instructional program promoting technology literacy.

Specifications for hardware selection shall be designed to ensure durable, functional and updated equipment. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall work with staff to develop a long-range plan appropriate for instructional technology for kindergarten through grade twelve and for technology usage in the management of the school's facilities and resources.

### Guidelines for Technology Purchases

The following policy guidelines have been established because of the District's interest in technology and the need to engage in thoughtful planning prior to purchase.

1. The most important criteria for selection of technology are the needs and objectives of the site where technology will be used.

  a.  The IT Department in conjunction with teachers and administrators involved will identify objectives, site needs and priorities.

  b.  Software selection and evaluation shall be weighed carefully in light of available technology and projected replacement hardware. All software must be compatible with licensing methods and installed network systems.

  c.  Hardware purchases shall be the result of consultations with users, demonstration of effectiveness, compatibility with district needs and evaluation of its worth from the standpoint of usability and "instructional merit." Purchases must also be compatible with currently used configurations and platforms.

  d.  Consolidation of purchases shall be planned to insure a more favorable price or bid and the ability to provide continuing hardware and software support.

  e.  All hardware and software acquisitions shall conform to current IT Department goals and initiatives regardless of the source of funding or whether the acquisition resulted from a donation.

2. Equipment and software purchase decisions shall be the result of comparisons and study of the products from a variety of the vendors.

3. Staff involvement in planning before purchase and in-service programs after purchase shall be considered. The goal of the professional development program will be to support staff at the current level of familiarity with technology and provide continuing training as their skills increase by offering mentoring, peer training, personal tutoring, and workshops.

4. A technical resource, hardware or software, shall not be taken out of service until all possible use of the resource within the District/school is exhausted or support is no longer feasible.
