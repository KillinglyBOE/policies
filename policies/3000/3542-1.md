## 3542.1 - Purposes and Facilities: Food Service

The school lunch program shall be an integral part of the total educational program. An attractive, wholesome, well-balanced lunch is essential for the best work from the students.

To accomplish this objective with appropriate economy, all administration of the food services program will be coordinated in the Office of the Food Services Director.  Business functions to be centralized will include central purchasing of food and supplies, a district-wide salary schedule for all food service employees, centrally planned menus, and regular audit of all accounts.

The educational aspects of the school lunch program will be the responsibility of each school principal, subject to advice, counsel and direction from the Food Service Director and the Superintendent of Schools, who is ultimately responsible for executing this policy.
