## 3543.13 - Mail and Delivery

A mail service system shall be maintained within the school system in order that communications from inside and outside sources may be delivered to the intended recipient in the most practicable way.

The use of school system mail facilities and personnel for the distribution of materials and communications shall be restricted mainly to those materials and communications that further the educational purposes of the school system.  The Superintendent may, by regulation, authorize certain exceptions without defeating the intent of this policy.

Political materials shall not be distributed through the school system mail boxes or school mail system unless received through the United States mail.

**Policy adopted:  June 10, 1999**
