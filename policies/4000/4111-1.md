## 4111.1 - Affirmative Action: Equal Employment Opportunity

The Board of Education will provide equal employment opportunities for all persons without regard to race, color, religious creed, age, marital status, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, mental retardation, pregnancy, or physical disability except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need.  Sexual harassment shall not be used to influence employment decisions, nor shall decisions be influenced, affected or determined on the basis of membership in or holding of office in an employee association or union.

The Board of Education directs the administration to set as a goal the recruitment, selection and employment of qualified people among racial and ethnic minority groups to the end that the school district’s employees will proportionately mirror the racial and ethnic composition of this community.

The Board of Education may request a periodic report from the Superintendent of Schools concerning the extent to which the above-mentioned affirmative action program goals are being achieved.

No advertisement of employment opportunities may by intent or design restrict employment based upon discrimination as defined by law.
