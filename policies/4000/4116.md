## 4116 - Probationary/Tenure Status

Certified personnel may attain tenure as provided by law. (Connecticut General Statutes 10-151)

The Board of Education expects thorough and competent evaluations of all personnel before they become eligible for tenure. This requires critical evaluation at four stages:

1.  At the time of selection

2.  During years one and two when emphasis on self-evaluation will help the teacher decide whether he/she commands the necessary skills to continue in the profession.

3.  During the third year when emphasis is on whether the success of the first two years can be sustained and developed.

4.  During the fourth year when it must be determined whether the teacher will be a permanent asset to the staff and if the Superintendent offers a contract for the following year, based upon the evaluation records.

Procedures for continuation or termination of a contract, failure to renew a teacher's contract, or appeals thereof shall be in accordance with Connecticut General Statute 10-151.
