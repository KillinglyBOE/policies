## 4118.13 - Conflict of Interest

The Board of Education wishes to avoid any conflict of interest on the part of its employees regarding their personal interests and the interests of the school district in dealing with suppliers, contractors and all organizations or individuals doing or seeking to do business with the school district.  For this reason, the Board of Education prohibits employees from directly or indirectly soliciting any gift; or accepting or receiving any gift having a value of twenty-five dollars ($25) or more, whether in the form of money, services, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise, or any other form, under circumstances in which it could be reasonably inferred that the gift was intended to influence the Board member or employee in the performance of his/her official duties or was intended as a reward for any official action on his/her part.
