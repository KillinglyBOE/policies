  "**Statutory mandated reporter**" means an individual required by Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 17a-101 to report suspected abuse and/or neglect of children.

  a)  has been abused or neglected;

  b)  has had non-accidental physical injury, or injury which is at variance with the history given for such injury, inflicted upon him/her; or

Such oral report shall be made by telephone or in person to the Commissioner of Children and Families or the local law enforcement agency.  The Department of Children and Families has established a 24 hour Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline at 1-800-842-2288 for the purpose of making such oral reports.

  (2)  The employee shall also make an oral report as soon as practicable to the Building Principal or his/her designee, and/or the Superintendent or his or her designee.

  (3)  In cases involving suspected or believed abuse or neglect by a school employee, the Superintendent or his/her designee shall immediately notify the child's parent or guardian that such a report has been made.

  (4)  Not later than forty-eight hours after making an oral report, the employee shall submit a written report to the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner's designee containing all of the required information.

  The written report should be submitted on the DCF-136 form or any other form designated for that purpose.

  (5)  The employee shall immediately submit a copy of the written report to the Building Principal or his/her designee and to the Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee.

  (6)  If the report concerns suspected abuse or neglect by a school employee holding a certificate, authorization or permit issued by the State Department of Education, the Commissioner of Children and Families (or his/her designee) shall submit a copy of the written report to the Commissioner of Education (or his/her designee).

    1.  The employee shall make an oral report as soon as practicable, but not later than twelve hours after the employee has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that a child has been abused or neglected or placed at imminent risk of serious harm.  Such oral report shall be made by telephone or in person to the Superintendent of Schools or his/her designee, to be followed by an immediate written report to the Superintendent or his/her designee.

    2.  If the Superintendent or his/her designee determines that there is reasonable cause to suspect or believe that a child has been abused or neglected or placed at imminent risk of serious harm, he/she shall cause reports to be made in accordance with the procedures set forth for statutory mandated reporters.

  b)  Nothing in this policy shall be construed to preclude an employee reporting suspected child abuse and/or neglect from reporting the same directly to the Commissioner of Children and Families.

7.  Investigation of the Report

  a)  The Superintendent or his/her designee shall thoroughly investigate reports of suspected abuse and neglect if/when such report involves an employee of the Board of Education or other individual under the control of the Board, provided such investigation does not impede an investigation by the Department of Children and Families ("DCF").  In all other cases, DCF shall be responsible for conducting the investigation with the cooperation and collaboration of the Board, as appropriate.

  b)  Recognizing that DCF is the lead agency for the investigation of child abuse and neglect reports, the Superintendent's investigation shall permit and give priority to any investigation conducted by the Commissioner of Children and Families or the appropriate local law enforcement agency.  The Superintendent shall conduct the district's investigation and take any disciplinary action, consistent with state law, upon notice from the Commissioner of Children and Families or the appropriate local law enforcement agency that the district's investigation will not interfere with the investigation of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the local law enforcement agency.

  c)  The Superintendent shall coordinate investigatory activities in order to minimize the number of interviews of any child and share information with other persons authorized to conduct an investigation of child abuse or neglect, as appropriate.

  d)  Any person reporting child abuse or neglect, or having any information relevant to alleged abuse or neglect, shall provide the Superintendent with all information related to the investigation that is in the possession or control of such person, except as expressly prohibited by state or federal law.

  e)  When the school district is conducting an investigation involving suspected abuse or neglect by an employee of the Board or other individual under the control of the Board, the Superintendent's investigation shall include an opportunity for the individual suspected of abuse or neglect to be heard with respect to the allegations contained within the report.  During the course of such investigation, the Superintendent may suspend a Board employee with pay or may place the employee on administrative leave with pay, pending the outcome of the investigation.  If the individual is one who provides services to or on behalf of students enrolled in the Killingly Public Schools, pursuant to a contract with the Board of Education, the Superintendent may suspend the provision of such services, and direct the individual to refrain from any contact with students enrolled in the Killingly Public Schools, pending the outcome of the investigation.

8.  Evidence of Abuse or Neglect by a School Employee

  a)  If, upon completion of the investigation by the Commissioner of Children and Families ("Commissioner"), the Superintendent has received a report from the Commissioner that he or she has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a school employee, as defined above, and has recommended that such employee be placed on the Department of Children and Families child abuse and neglect registry, the Superintendent shall request (and the law provides) that DCF notify the Superintendent not later than five (5) working days after such

   a)  finding, and provide the Superintendent with records, whether or not created by DCF, concerning such investigation.  The Superintendent shall suspend such school employee. Such suspension shall be with pay and shall not result in the diminution or termination of benefits to such employee. 

   b)  Not later than seventy-two (72) hours after such suspension, the Superintendent shall notify the Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education, or the Commissioner of Education's representative, of the reasons for and conditions of the suspension. The Superintendent shall disclose such records to the Commissioner of Education and the Board of Education or its attorney for purposes of review of employment status or the status of such employee's certificate, permit or authorization, if any.

   c)  The suspension of a school employee employed in a position requiring a certificate shall remain in effect until the Superintendent and/or Board of Education acts pursuant to the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. §10-151. If the contract of employment of such certified school employee is terminated, or such certified school employee resigns such employment, the Superintendent shall notify the Commissioner of Education, or the Commissioner of Education's representative, within seventy-two hours after such termination or resignation.

   d)  The suspension of a school employee employed in a position requiring an authorization or permit shall remain in effect until the Superintendent and/or Board of Education acts pursuant to any applicable termination provisions. If the contract of employment of a school employee holding an authorization or permit from the State Department of Education is terminated, or such school employee resigns such employment, the Superintendent shall notify the Commissioner of Education, or the Commissioner of Education's representative, within seventy-two hours after such termination or resignation.

   e)  Regardless of the outcome of any investigation by the Commissioner of Children and Families and/or the police, the Superintendent and/or the Board, as appropriate, may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with the provisions of any applicable statute, if the Superintendent's investigation produces evidence that a child has been abused or neglected by a school employee.

9.  Evidence of Abuse or Neglect by An Independent Contractor of the Board of Education

  If the investigation by the Superintendent and/or the Commissioner of Children and Families produces evidence that a child has been abused or neglected by any individual who provides services to or on behalf of students enrolled in the Killingly Public Schools, pursuant to a contract with the Board of Education, the Superintendent shall permanently suspend the provision of such services, and direct the individual to refrain from any contact with students enrolled in the Killingly Public Schools.

  Except as provided in Section 12 below, any employee who fails to comply with the requirements of this policy shall be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

12.  Non-discrimination Policy/Prohibition Against Retaliation

  The Board of Education expressly prohibits retaliation against individuals reporting child abuse or neglect and shall not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against any employee who, in good faith makes, or in good faith does not make, a report pursuant to this policy, or testifies or is about to testify in any proceeding involving abuse or neglect. The Board of Education also prohibits any employee from hindering or preventing or attempting to hinder or prevent any employee from making a report pursuant to this policy or state law concerning suspected child abuse or neglect or testifying in any proceeding involving child abuse or neglect.
