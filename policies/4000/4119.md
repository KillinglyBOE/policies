## 4119 - Staff Conduct

The Board reaffirms one of the oldest beliefs in education:  One of the best methods of instruction is that of setting a good example.

The Board expects that the staff of the district will strive to set the kind of example for students that will serve them well in their own conduct and behavior which will contribute toward an appropriate school atmosphere.

To that end, in dress, conduct, language and interpersonal relationships all staff should recognize that they are being continuously observed by students while on duty or attending school functions and that their actions and demeanor will be reflected in the conduct of the students.

The personal life of an employee will not be the concern nor warrant the attention of the Board unless it directly prevents the employee from effectively performing assigned functions during duty hours, or as it violates the law or contractual agreements.
