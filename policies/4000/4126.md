## 4126 - Consultants

The Board of Education encourages the use of consultants when it is clear they can provide valuable and necessary specialized services not normally required on a continuing basis and which cannot be provided by district personnel because of limitations of time, experience or knowledge.

Funds for consultant help should be provided for in planning specific projects or programs and will be charged to that particular budget category.
