### Staff Development

The implementation of Board of Education policy 4131 necessitates, per Connecticut General Statute 10-220a, as amended, the development and implementation of professional development activities, for a minimum of eighteen hours annually. To meet this requirement, the administration will take the following steps:

a.  Establish a professional development committee, consisting of certified employees, including their union representatives, and other school personnel deemed appropriate.  The committee will be responsible for, the development, evaluation and annual updating of a comprehensive local professional development plan, for certified staff.

b.  The plan will be directly related to the educational goals proposed by the Board pursuant to C.G.S. 10-220(b), and be developed in full consideration of the priorities and needs related to student outcomes as determined by the State Board of Education.

c.  The members chosen by the Board to be on the Professional Development Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.

d.  The preponderance of the planned professional development activities will be in a small group or individual group setting which must:

  1.  be a comprehensive, sustained and intensive approach to improving teacher and administrator effectiveness in increasing student knowledge achievement;

  2.  focus on refining and improving various effective teaching methods that are shared between and among educators;

  3.  foster collective responsibility for improved student performance, and

  4.  be comprised of professional learning that meets the following criteria:

  is aligned with rigorous state student academic achievement standards;

  *  conducted at the school among educators and facilitated by principals, coaches, mentors, distinguished educators or other appropriate teachers;

  *  occurs frequently on an individual basis or among groups of teachers in a job-embedded process of continuous improvement; and

  *  includes a repository or best practices for teaching methods developed by educators within each school that is continuously available to such educators for comment and updating.

e.  The staff development experiences may be made available by the Board directly, or through a RESC, a cooperative arrangement with another Board of Education, or through a provider approved by the Commissioner.

f.  It is the responsibility of each teacher, in collaboration with his/her administrator, to identify and participate in appropriate professional development activities to address the needs identified in his/her annual evaluation. A log or other tracking method shall be created or the professional development that has been completed, subject to review and audit by the Connecticut State Department of Education.

g.  The time and location of professional development activities will be in accordance with an agreement between the Board of Education and the exclusive bargaining unit, or in the absence of such agreement or language pertaining to time and location, by a determination of the Board of Education.

h.  The professional development activities must be designed to:

  1.  improve the integration of reading instruction, literacy and numeracy enhancement and cultural awareness into instructional practice,

  2.  include strategies to improve English language learner instruction into instructional practice,

  3.  improve teacher and administrator practice based on results and findings from teacher evaluations reported by the Superintendent or his/her designee, and provide professional growth,

  4.  be comprehensive, sustained, and intensive enough to improve teacher and administrator effectiveness in raising student performance,

  5.  be aligned with state student academic achievement standards, and

  6.  foster collective responsibility for improved student performance.

i.  The capabilities of certified staff to improve student learning will involve teacher review of curricular content, teaching methods and materials, educational philosophy and goals, social change and related topics.

j.  Professional development activities will include preparation to meet the needs of students of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Planning and implementation of such programs will be done cooperatively by administration, teachers and parent advisory groups.

k.  Administrators and supervisors are to receive training pursuant to their obligations in the evaluation of teachers and administrators under the teacher evaluation and support program. (15 hours for each five year period)

l.  Professional development activities should respond directly to the educational needs of the student body, including:

  1.  content areas such as language arts, including reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing and enacting; math, social studies and science;

  2.  methodological areas such as motivation, teaching techniques, including the use of computers in the classroom and classroom management; and second language acquisition; and

  3.  affective areas of interpersonal relations of students and faculty, student growth and development and staff communication, problem solving, and decision-making.

m.  The administration will prepare an annual professional development program budget for Board approval.

n.  The effectiveness of the professional development program will be assessed on an annual basis. Such assessment must indicate that the professional development activities:

  1.  Were planned in response to identified needs;

  2.  Were provided by qualified instructional personnel, as appropriate;

  3.  Met the requirements for participation in the activity shared with participants before the commencement of the activity;

  4.  Are evaluated in terms of effectiveness and contribution to the attainment of school and/or District goals; and

p.  The District, in a manner determined by the Connecticut State Department of Education, will attest that District educators have participated in professional development activities in accordance with his/her annual evaluation plan.

> NOTE:  The thrust of professional development focuses more on individual or small group job-embedded processes. School districts will need to evaluate the manner in which the data pertaining to the professional development program is managed and tracked. Previous methods used to track CEUs may be inadequate. Discussion is recommended with teachers to determine how best to document and track professional development activities in an efficient and accurate manner. Software programs should be investigated.
