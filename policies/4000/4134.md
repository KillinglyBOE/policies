## 4134 - Tutoring

It is expected that every effort will be made by the Principal and teacher to resolve the learning problems of a student at school before recommending that parents engage a tutor or seek other outside professional help. The Board of Education believes that by maintaining high quality instructional staff and providing for a rich, varied curriculum, the need for individual tutoring is minimized.

Should, however, individual tutoring be recommended in exceptional cases, the Superintendent is directed to establish such rules as will protect both the school system and the teachers from charges of conflict of interest.
