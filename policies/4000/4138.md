## 4138 - Non-School Employment

Personnel of the schools may receive compensation for outside activities as long as these activities do not interfere with the proper discharge of their assigned duties or do not cause poor public relations within the community.  It is expected that any outside activity should be carried on in a businesslike and ethical manner.
