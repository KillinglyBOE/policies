### Universal Precautions

Universal precautions are intended to prevent occupational exposure to a bloodborne infectious agent through contact with blood and other potentially infectious materials. Since blood is the single most important source of a bloodborne infectious agent (such as HIV or HBV) in the occupational setting, one should assume that all blood, or body fluids containing visible blood, may carry an infectious agent. Universal precautions also apply to semen and vaginal secretions and non-excretory body fluids, such a cerebrospinal fluid, but these are not considered a source of transmission in the school setting.

Universal precautions require that gloves be used for touching blood, or body fluids that contain visible blood, whenever possible. Gowns or protective clothing should be used if soiling of clothing with blood or blood-containing body fluids is likely. Protective eyewear or face shields may be needed when there is risk of splattering or splashing blood or body fluids containing blood in the eyes, mouth or nose during certain procedures.

Disposable gloves (non-sterile or sterile), either latex or vinyl, provide barrier protection for both the student and the hands of the caregiver during performance of tasks when contact with blood, or body fluids with visible blood, is likely. These gloves must never be washed or cleaned with the intent to reuse. Soaps and disinfectants can cause deterioration or increase permeability of disposable gloves. Clean disposable gloves must be used for each task, removed as soon as the task is completed and disposed of appropriately. This activity should be immediately followed by routine handwashing.

General purpose utility gloves (rubber gloves) for housekeeping chores which involve potential contact with blood or body fluids may be decontaminated after contact and reused but should be discarded if there are any signs of deterioration such as: holes, peeling, cracking, or discoloration.

Universal precautions do not apply to saliva. General infection control practices do recommend the use of gloves for examination of mucous membranes, endotracheal suctioning or when the caregiver's hand(s) must enter a student’s mouth to perform a specific treatment. Gloves need not be worn when feeding or wiping saliva or nasal discharge from the skin with a tissue.

Universal precautions do not apply to urine, feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, or vomitus unless visible blood is present. However, general infection control practices (for the prevention of transmission of other types of infectious agents) do recommend the use of gloves when performing such tasks as diapering, assisting with toileting, changing a dressing on a draining wound, or cleaning soiled articles of clothing.
