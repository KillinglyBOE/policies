## 4150 - Leaves and Vacations

Employed personnel of the school district may wish or be required to be absent for several reasons:

1.  Those beyond their control, such as personal sickness or injury, jury duty, military service or emergencies.

2.  Those governed by compassion or conviction, such as family illness, bereavement, and other personal reasons.

3.  Those stemming from occupational status such as attendance at meetings, conventions, in-service courses and seminars, and other patterns of additional study.

4.  Those provided by scheduled vacations.

The Board of Education recognizes that absences for such reasons are justifiable and will provide for employee absences as authorized by law and current employee organization agreements.
