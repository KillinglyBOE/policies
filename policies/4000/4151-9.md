## 4151.9 - Military Leave

Any regular employee shall be entitled to a military leave of absence without pay for ordered military duty in the armed services of the United States either through selective service induction, membership in reserve forces or enlistment in a National Guard agency. Such employees will be returned to their former position as such leave is thirty (30) days or less and may be placed in their former position or one which is available and suitable if returning from full time active duty of a duration of greater than thirty (30) days. No employee will be subject to a loss of seniority due to such leave. In order to exercise these rights an employee must apply to the Board for employment within ninety (90) days following a discharge or release from duty.

To be entitled for a military leave of absence the employee must immediately notify his/her supervisor and the Superintendent of Schools in writing upon receipt of an active duty assignment. Such letter must be supported by copies of the appropriate orders to active duty.

In the event of a conflict between any provision of this policy and any federal or state statutes relating to military service by public employees, the provisions of such pertinent federal or state statutes then applicable shall take precedence.
