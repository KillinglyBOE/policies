2.  For a high school senior whose parents have moved out of the district during the school year.

3.  For a student who has less than two monthâ€™s of a school-year remaining and the parents have moved out of the district.

4.  When a child is placed in the school district by an appropriate state agency.

5.  For foreign exchange students when they are sponsored by a recognized foreign exchange student placement program and when approved by the Superintendent of Schools.

6.  At such other times as may be deemed appropriate by the Superintendent of Schools providing he/she notifies the Board of Education of the decision to allow a non-resident student to attend school in the district.

Permission shall be granted for non-resident students to attend the Killingly schools only when class enrollments in the district will permit the addition of the out of district students.

Transportation beyond that normally provided for students living in the district shall not be provided to non-resident-students.

This policy does not apply to districts which have a written agreement with the Board of Education for the attendance of their students or for students enrolled in the regional vocational agriculture program.
