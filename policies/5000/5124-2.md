## 5124.2 - Release of Report Cards

Unless a specific request has been obtained from a parent to act otherwise, report cards are to be given only to the student to whom the report card belongs and not to a sibling or friend.

A non-custodial parent, upon written request to the school principal, may receive a copy of his/her childâ€™s report card unless there is a court order to the contrary.

Report cards, transcripts and other student records may be withheld from release to those students who have outstanding obligations with the district until such time that those obligations are met.

**Regulation approved:  August 11, 2004**
