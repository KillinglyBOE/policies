## 5131.911 Appendix A - ANNUAL BULLYING NOTICE

> State Law requires that boards of education notify students annually of the process by which they may anonymously report acts of bullying to teachers and school administrators. We suggest that this notice be included in a student handbook.

Bullying behavior by any student in the Killingly Public Schools is strictly prohibited, and such conduct may result in disciplinary action, including suspension and/or expulsion from school.

“**Bullying**” means any overt acts by a student or a group of students directed against another student with the intent to ridicule, harass, humiliate or intimidate the other student while on school grounds, at school-sponsored activity, or on a school bus, which acts are repeated against the same student over time.

Students may file verbal or written complaints concerning suspected bullying behavior, and students shall be permitted to anonymously report acts of bullying to teachers and school administrators. In addition, parents may also file written complaints concerning suspected bullying behavior. Any report of suspected bullying behavior will be promptly reviewed. If acts of bullying are verified, prompt disciplinary action may be taken against the perpetrator, consistent with his/her rights of due process. Board policy and regulation # 5114 set forth this prohibition and the related procedures in detail, and are available to students and their parents/guardians upon request.

### Informal/Verbal Complaints of Bullying by Students

Students may make complaints of conduct that they consider to be bullying by verbally reporting to a teacher, administrator, or other professional employee such as a guidance counselor, school psychologist, nurse, social worker or school therapist.  Student complaints of bullying should specify the actions giving rise to the suspicion of bullying, including the time and place of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of such suspected bullying, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses.  A teacher, other professional employee, or administrator who receives a student complaint shall promptly reduce the complaint to writing, including the information provided by the student.  The written report by the teacher, other professional employee and/or administrator shall be promptly forwarded to the building Principal (or other responsible program administrator) for review and action.

### Formal/Written Complaints of Bullying

Students and/or their parents or guardians may also file formal written complaints of conduct that they consider to be bullying.  Such written reports should specify the actions giving rise to the suspicion of bullying, including time and place of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of such suspected bullying, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses.  Such reports may be filed with any teacher or administrator, and they shall be promptly forwarded to the building Principal for review and action.

### Anonymous Complaints of Bullying

Students who make complaints of bullying to a teacher and/or administrator may request that their name be maintained in confidence by the teacher(s) or administrator(s) who receives the complaint.  Should anonymity be requested, the Principal or his/her designee shall meet with the student to review the request for anonymity and the impact that maintaining anonymity of the complaint may have on the investigation of the complaint and/or possible remedial action.  At such meeting, the student shall be given the choice as to whether to maintain the anonymity of the complaint.  Anonymous complaints shall be reviewed and reasonable action will be taken to address the situation, to the extent such action may be taken that (1) does not disclose the source of the complaint, and (2) is consistent with the due process rights of the student(s) alleged to have committed acts of bullying.
