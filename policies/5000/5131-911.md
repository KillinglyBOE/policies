  **Safe School Climate Specialist**

  For the school year commencing July 1, 2012, and each school year thereafter, each school Principal shall serve, or designate someone to serve, as the Safe School Climate Specialist for the school.

  The Specialist in each school shall:

6. Investigate or supervise the investigation of reported acts of bullying or teen dating violence in the school in accordance with the District's Safe School Climate Plan;

7. Collect and maintain records of reports and investigations of bullying and teen dating violence in the school; and

8. Act as the primary school official responsible for preventing, identifying and responding to bullying and teen dating violence reports in the school.


C.  Annual Notification of the Complaint Process

The process by which students may make formal, informal, and anonymous complaints as set forth below shall be publicized annually, at the beginning of the school year, in the student handbook of each of the District schools. In addition, this Safe School Climate Plan shall be placed on the District website and the website of each school.

D.  Formal Written Complaints

Students and/or their parents or guardians may file written reports of conduct that they consider to be bullying or teen dating violence.  Such written reports shall be reasonably specific as to the actions giving rise to the suspicion of bullying or teen dating violence, including time and place of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of such suspected bullying or teen dating violence, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses. Such reports may be filed with any school employee, and they shall be promptly forwarded to the Safe School Climate Specialist or another school administrator, if the Safe School specialist is unavailable, for review and action in accordance with Section IV below.

E.  Informal/Verbal Complaints by Students

Students may make an informal complaint of conduct that they consider to be bullying or teen dating violence by verbal report to the Safe School Climate Specialist, or to any school employee, as defined, or administrator.  Such informal complaints shall be reasonably specific as to the actions giving rise to the suspicion of bullying or teen dating violence, including time and place of the conduct alleged, the number of such incidents, the target of such suspected bullying or teen dating violence, and the names of any potential student or staff witnesses.  A school employee, or administrator or the Safe School Climate Specialist who receives an informal complaint shall promptly reduce the complaint to writing, including the information provided.  Such written report by the school employee, administrator, if not the Safe School Climate Specialist, shall be promptly forwarded to the Building Principal for review and action in accordance with Section IV below.

F.  Anonymous Complaints

Students who make informal complaints as set forth above may request that their name be maintained in confidence by the school employee who receives the complaint.  Should anonymity be requested, the Safe School Climate Specialist, if not the Principal or his/her designee, shall meet with the student to review the request for anonymity and the impact that maintaining anonymity of the complaint may have on the investigation of the complaint and/or possible remedial action.  At such meeting, the student shall be given the choice as to whether to maintain the anonymity of the complaint.

Anonymous complaints shall be reviewed and reasonable action will be taken to address the situation, to the extent such action may be taken that \(1\) does not disclose the source of the complaint, and \(2\) is consistent with the due process rights of the student\(s\) alleged to have committed acts of bullying.  No disciplinary action shall be taken solely on the basis of an anonymous report.

#### IV.  Staff Responsibilities and Intervention Strategies

A.  Teachers and Other School Staff

School employees who witness acts of bullying or teen dating violence, as defined above, or who receive reports of bullying or teen dating violence shall promptly notify the Safe School Climate Specialist or another school administrator if the Safe School Climate Specialist is unavailable, not later than one school day after such employee witnesses or receives a report of bullying or teen dating violence. A written report must be filed not later than two school days after making such an oral report concerning the events witnessed or reported.

School employees who receive student or parent reports of suspected bullying or teen dating violence shall promptly notify the Safe School Climate Specialist of such report\(s\). If the report is a formal, written complaint, such complaint shall be forwarded promptly \(no later than the next school day\) to the Safe School Climate Specialist or another school administrator if the Safe School Climate Specialist is unavailable.  If the report is an informal complaint by a student that is received by a school employee, he or she shall prepare a succinct written report of the informal complaint, which shall be forwarded promptly \(no later than the next school day\) to the Safe School Climate Specialist or another school administrator if the Safe School Climate Specialist is unavailable. If the report is an informal complaint by a student that is received by a school employee, this employee shall verbally report the matter to the Safe School Climate Specialist not later than the next school day. In addition to addressing both informal and formal complaints, school employees and other are encouraged to address the issue of bullying or teen dating violence in other interactions with students. Teachers and other professionals may find opportunities to educate students about bullying and teen dating violence and help eliminate bullying behavior and teen dating violence through class discussions, counseling, and reinforcement of socially-appropriate behavior. All school employees including teachers and other professional employees should intervene promptly whenever they observe student conduct that has the purpose or effect of ridiculing, humiliating or intimidating another student, even if such conduct does not meet the formal definition of "bullying."

B.  Responsibilities of the Safe School Climate Specialist

1. Investigation

  The Safe School Climate Specialist shall be promptly notified of any formal or informal complaint of suspected bullying or teen dating violence received by any school employee. The Safe School Climate Specialist shall investigate or supervise the investigation of reported acts of bullying or teen dating violence in the school in accordance with the District's Safe School Climate Plan. All such complaints shall be investigated promptly. Prompt notice must be provided to the parents/guardians of the person bullied or the victim of teen dating violence and the student alleged to have committed the act of bullying or teen dating violence that such investigation has begun. The investigation must be completed promptly after the receipt by the Safe School Climate Specialist of any written report. In order to allow the District to adequately investigate all formal complaints, the parent of the student suspected of being bullied or teen dating violence must complete a consent form that allows their District to release that student's name to those third parties who the District contacts as part of its investigation of that complaint with regard to the investigation of informal complaints, the parent of the student suspected of being bullied or teen dating violence must complete the above-referenced consent form so long as that student has not requested anonymity.

  A written report of the investigation shall be prepared when the investigation is complete.  Such report shall include findings of fact, a determination of whether acts of bullying were verified, and, when acts of bullying or teen dating violence are verified, a recommendation for intervention, including disciplinary action.  Where appropriate, written witness statements shall be attached to the report.

  The school shall notify parents or guardians of all students involved in a verified act of bullying or teen dating violence not later than forty-eight \(48\) hours after the completion of the investigation. The notice shall be simultaneously mailed to the parent/guardian with whom the student primarily resides and in the case of a divorced/split situation, to the other parent/guardian if requested. The notice must describe the school's response, measures being taken by the school to ensure the safety of the students against whom such act was directed, and any consequences that may result from further acts of bullying or teen dating violence.

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, when a student making an informal complaint has requested anonymity, the investigation of such complaint shall be limited as is appropriate in view of the anonymity of the complainant.  Such limitation of investigation may include restricting action to a simple review of the complaint \(with or without discussing it with the alleged perpetrator\), subject to receipt of further information and/or the withdrawal by the complaining student of the condition that his/her report be anonymous.

2. Remedial Actions

  Verified acts of bullying or teen dating violence shall result in intervention by the Building Principal or his/her designee that is intended to address the acts of the perpetrator and the needs of the victim and to assure that the prohibition against bullying behavior or teen dating violence is enforced, with the goal that any such bullying behavior or teen dating violence will end as a result.

  Bullying behavior can take many forms and can vary dramatically in how serious it is, and what impact it has on the victim and other students. Accordingly, there is no one prescribed response to verified acts of bullying. While conduct that rises to the level of "bullying" as defined above will generally warrant disciplinary action against the perpetrator of such bullying, whether and to what extent to impose disciplinary action \(detention, in-school suspension; suspension or expulsion\) is a matter for the professional discretion of the Building Principal \(or responsible program administrator or his/her designee.\) The following sets forth possible interventions for building principals to enforce the Board's prohibition against bullying.  No disciplinary action may be taken solely on the basis of an anonymous complaint.

  The following sets forth permissible interventions for building principals \(or other responsible program administrators\) to enforce the Board's prohibition against bullying and teen dating violence.

  a.  Non-disciplinary Interventions

  When verified acts of bullying and teen dating violence are identified early and/or when such verified acts of bullying and teen dating violence do not reasonably require a disciplinary response, students may be counseled as to the definition of bullying or teen dating violence, its prohibition, and their duty to avoid any conduct that could be considered bullying or teen dating violence.

  If a complaint arises out of conflict between students or groups of students, peer mediation may be considered. Special care, however, is warranted in referring such cases to peer mediation.  A power imbalance may make the process intimidating for the victim and therefore inappropriate.  In such cases, the victim should be given additional support.  Alternatively, peer mediation may be deemed inappropriate to address the concern.

  In any instance in which bullying or teen dating violence is verified, the building Principal \(or other responsible program administrator\) shall invite the parents or guardians of the student against whom such act was directed, and the parents or guardians of a student who commits any verified act of bullying or teen dating violence, to a meeting to communicate to such parents or guardians the measures being taken by the school to ensure the student's safety and to prevent further acts of bullying or teen dating violence. The meeting of parents/guardians of the bullied student or the victim of teen dating violence and the student committing the bullying or teen dating violence shall be separate and distinct from each other.

  b.  Disciplinary Interventions

  When acts of bullying and teen dating violence are verified and a disciplinary response is warranted, students are subject to the full range of disciplinary consequences. Anonymous complaints that are not otherwise verified, however, shall not be the basis for disciplinary action.

  In-school suspension and suspension may be imposed only after informing the accused perpetrator of the reasons for the proposed suspension and giving him/her an opportunity to explain the situation, in accordance with the Board's Student Discipline policy.

  Expulsion may be imposed only after a hearing before the Board of Education, a committee of the Board or an impartial hearing officer designated by the Board of Education in accordance with Board policy.  This consequence shall be reserved for serious incidents of bullying and teen dating violence and/or when past interventions have not been successful in eliminating bullying or teen dating violence behavior.

  c.  Interventions for Bullied Students

  The Safe School Climate Specialist/Building Principal \(or other responsible program administrator\) or his/her designee shall intervene in order to address repeated incidents of bullying or teen dating violence against a single individual. Intervention strategies for a bullied student or student against whom teen dating violence was directed may include the following:

  * Counseling;

  * Increased supervision and monitoring of student to observe and intervene in bullying or teen dating violence situations;

  * Encouragement of student to seek help when victimized or witnessing victimization;

  * Peer mediation where appropriate.


3. General Prevention and Intervention Strategies

  In addition to the prompt investigation of complaints of bullying and teen dating violence and direct intervention when acts of bullying or teen dating violence are verified, other District actions may ameliorate any potential problem with bullying or teen dating violence in school or at school-sponsored activities. A focus will be placed on district and school efforts to improve school climate based upon the National School Climate Standards.

  While no specific action is required and school needs for such interventions may vary from time to time, the following list of potential intervention strategies shall serve as a resource for administrators, teachers and other professional staff members in each school:

  a.  Implementation of a positive behavioral interventions and supports process or another evidence-based model approach for safe school climate or for the prevention of bullying or teen dating violence, including any such program identified by the Department of Education;

  b.  A safe school climate assessment on or after July 1, 2012 and biennially thereafter to determine the prevalence of bullying or teen dating violence.

  c.  Establishment by the school Principal of a Safe School Climate Committee in each District school or the designation of an existing committee that is responsible for fostering a safe school climate and addressing issues related to bullying and teen dating violence in the school.

  For the school year commencing July 1, 2012, and each school year thereafter, the Principal of each District school shall establish a new committee or designate at least one existing committee that is responsible for developing and fostering a safe school climate and addressing issues related to bullying and teen dating violence in the school. The committee must include at least one parent/guardian of a student enrolled in the school, appointed by the Principal.

  The Safe School Climate Committee shall:

  1. Receive copies of completed reports following investigations of bullying and teen dating violence;

  2. Identify and address patterns of bullying and teen dating violence among students in the school;

  3. Implement the provisions of the school security plan and safety plan, \(developed pursuant to Section 87 of PA 13-3\) regarding the collection, evaluation and reporting of information relating to instances of disturbing or threatening behavior that may not meet the definition of bullying \(defined in Connecticut General Statutes 10-222d\) and report such information, as necessary, to the District Safe School Climate Coordinator and to the school's security and safety committee.

  4. Review and amend school policies relating to bullying and teen dating violence;

  5. Review and make recommendation to the District Safe School Climate Coordinator regarding the District's Safe Climate Plan based on issues and experiences specific to the school;

  6. Educate students, school employees and parents and guardians of students on issues relating to bullying and teen dating violence;

  7. Collaborate with the District Safe School Climate Coordinator in the collection of data regarding bullying and teen dating violence; and

  Parent members of the Safe School Climate Committee are excluded from activities \#1 and \#3 or any other activity that may compromise the confidentiality of a student.

  d.  Adequate adult supervision of outdoor areas, hallways, the lunchroom and other specific areas where bullying or teen dating violence is likely to occur;

  e.  Inclusion of grade-appropriate bullying and teen dating violence education and prevention curricula in kindergarten through high school;

  f.  Individual interventions with the perpetrator, parents and school employees, and interventions with the bullied student, or student who commits teen dating violence, parents and school employees. Such interventions with the bullied child or victim of teen dating violence may include referrals to a school counselor, psychologist, or other appropriate social or mental health services, and periodic follow-up by the safe school climate specialist with the bullied child;

  g.  School-wide training related to safe school climate;

  h.  Promotion of parent involvement in bullying and teen dating violence prevention through individual or team participation in meetings, trainings and individual interventions;

  i.  Respectful responses to bullying and teen dating violence concerns raised by students, parents or staff;

  j.  Planned professional development programs addressing bully/victim and teen dating perpetrator/victim problems;

  k.  Student peer training, education and support. Use of peers to help ameliorate the plight of victims and include them in group activities;

  l.  Avoidance of sex-role stereotyping \(e.g., males need to be strong and tough\);

  m.  Continuing awareness and involvement on the part of staff and parents with regards to prevention and intervention strategies;

  n.  Modeling by all school employees of positive, respectful, and supportive behavior toward students;

  o.  Creating a school atmosphere of team spirit and collaboration that promotes appropriate social behavior by students in support of others;

#### V.  Reporting Obligations

A.  Report to the Parent or Guardian of the Perpetrator

If after investigation, acts of bullying or teen dating violence by a specific student are verified, not later than forty-eight \(48\) hours after the completion of the investigation, the Building Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist or his/her designee shall notify the parent or guardian of the perpetrator in writing of that finding.  If disciplinary consequences are imposed against such student, a description of such discipline shall be included in such notification. In addition, the school shall invite the parent/guardian of a student who commits any verified act of bullying or teen dating violence \(after the completion of the investigation\) to a meeting to communicate to the parents/guardians the measures being taken by the school to ensure the safety and measures being taken by the school to ensure the student's safety and to prevent further acts of bullying or teen dating violence. Records will be maintained by the School Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist of the bullying and teen dating violence reports, subsequent investigations and parental/guardian meetings.

B.  Reports to the Targeted Student and his/her Parent or Guardian

If after investigation, acts of bullying or teen dating violence against a specific student are verified, the Building Principal/Safe Climate Specialist or his/her designee shall notify the parent or guardian of the victim of such finding, not later than forty-eight \(48\) hours after the completion of the investigation.  In providing such notification, care must be taken to respect the statutory privacy rights of the perpetrator of such bullying or teen dating violence.  The specific disciplinary consequences imposed on the perpetrator, as reflected in the student's educational records, shall not be disclosed to the parents or guardian of the victim, except as provided by law \(e.g., court order/subpoena\). In addition, the school shall invite the parent/guardian of the student against whom the verified act of bullying or teen dating violence was directed, after the completion of the investigation, to a meeting to communicate to the parents/guardians the measures being taken by the school to ensure the safety and measures being taken by the school to ensure the targeted student's safety and to prevent further acts of bullying or teen dating violence. Records will be maintained by the School Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist of the bullying and teen dating violence reports, subsequent investigations and parental/guardian meetings.

Notices shall be simultaneously mailed to the parent/guardian with whom the student primarily resides and the other parent/guardian if requested.  This mailing requirement shall be in effect for as long as the student attends the school in which the original request is made.

C.  List of Verified Acts of Bullying/Teen Dating Violence

The Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist of each school shall establish a procedure to document and maintain records relating to reports and investigations of bullying and teen dating violence in such school and maintain a list of the number of verified acts of bullying and teen dating violence in the school, and this list shall be available for public inspection upon request.  The list shall be reported annually to the Department of Education in such manner as prescribed by the Commissioner of Education. Given that any determination of bullying or teen dating violence involves repeated acts over time, each report prepared in accordance with Section III \(1\) above that includes verified acts of bullying or teen dating violence shall be tallied as one verified act of bullying or teen dating violence unless the specific actions that are the subject of the report involve separate and distinct acts of bullying or teen dating violence.  The list shall be limited to the number of such verified acts of bullying or teen dating violence in the school, and it shall not set out the particulars of each verified act, including but not limited to any personally identifiable student information, which is confidential information by law.

#### VI.  Prohibition against Discrimination and Retaliation

A.  Safety

Discrimination and/or retaliation against any person who reports bullying or teen dating violence, provides information during an investigation of an act of bullying or teen dating violence, or witnesses or has reliable information about bullying or teen dating violence is prohibited.

The continuation and perpetuation of bullying or teen dating violence of a student through the dissemination of hurtful or demeaning material by any other student is prohibited.

The District will not tolerate any unlawful or disruptive behavior, including any form of bullying or teen dating violence, cyberbullying, discrimination or retaliation in our school buildings, on school grounds, or in school related activities. All reports and complaints of bullying, teen dating violence, cyberbullying, discrimination and retaliation will be investigated promptly and prompt action will be taken to end that behavior and restore the student's against whom such bullying or teen dating violence was directed \(target's\) sense of safety. This commitment is to be supported in all aspects of the school community, including curricula, instructional programs, staff development, extracurricular activities, and parent/guardian involvement.

Before formally investigating the allegations of bullying, teen dating violence, discrimination or retaliation, the Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist or designee will take steps to assess the need to restore a sense of safety to the alleged student against whom such bullying or teen dating violence was directed \(target\) and/or to protect the alleged target from possible further incidents. Responses to promote safety may include, but are not limited to, creating a personal safety plan; pre-determining seating arrangements for the alleged victim \(target\) and/or the alleged perpetrator in the classroom, at lunch, or on the bus; identifying a staff member who will act as a "safe person" for the alleged student against whom such bullying or teen dating violence was directed \(target\); and altering the alleged perpetrator's schedule and access to the alleged target. The Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist will take additional steps to promote safety during the course of and after the investigation, as necessary.

Alternate language to previous paragraph: The Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist or designee will consider what adjustments, if any are needed in the school environment to enhance the student against whom such bullying or teen dating violence was directed a sense of safety and that of others as well. One strategy that the Principal/Safe School climate specialist or designee may use is to increase adult supervision at transition times and in locations where bullying or teen dating violence is known to have occurred or is likely to occur.

The Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist will implement appropriate strategies for protecting from bullying, teen dating violence or retaliation a student who has reported bullying, teen dating violence or retaliation, a student who has witnessed bullying, teen dating violence or retaliation, a student who provides information during an investigation, or a student who has reliable information about a reported act of bullying, teen dating violence or retaliation.

Within a reasonable period of time following the determination and the ordering of remedial and/or disciplinary action, the Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist or designee will contact the victim to determine whether there has been a recurrence of the prohibited conduct and whether additional supportive measures are needed. If determined necessary, the Principal/Safe School Climate Specialist will work with appropriate school staff to implement them immediately.

B.  Law Enforcement Notification

The School Principal or his/her designee shall notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency when such Principal or the Principal's designee believes any acts of bullying or teen dating violence constitute criminal conduct.

#### VII.  Training Requirements for School Staff

A.  Certified staff of the District shall be provided in-service training on the prevention, identification and response to school bullying, and teen dating violence and the prevention of and response to youth suicide. \(The Board, subject to the approval of the State Department of Education, is not required to offer an in-service program regarding bullying or youth suicide prevention and intervention if it instead implements an evidence-based model approach to this issue.\)

B.  Beginning teachers shall satisfactorily complete instructional modules as required by C.G.S. 10-145a which shall include a module in classroom management and climate, which shall include training regarding the prevention, identification, and response to school bullying, teen dating violence and the prevention of and response to youth suicide.

C.  Non-certified staff of the District will participate in annual training to be provided, within available appropriations, by the Connecticut State Department of Education. The training may be presented in person by mentors, offered in state-wide workshops, or through on-line courses. Such training may include, but is not limited to:

1. Developmentally appropriate strategies to prevent bullying and teen dating violence among students in school and outside the school setting,

2. Developmentally appropriate strategies for immediate and effective interventions to stop bullying and teen dating violence,

3. Information regarding the interaction and relationship between students committing acts of bullying and teen dating violence, students against whom such acts of bullying and teen dating violence are directed and witnesses of such acts of bullying and teen dating violence,

4. Research findings on bullying, such as information about the types of students who have been shown to be at-risk for bullying and teen dating violence in the school setting,

5. Information about the incidence and nature of cyberbullying as defined in C.G.S. 10-222d, as amended, or

6. Internet safety issues as they relate to cyberbullying.


### VIII.  Notification Requirements

A.  A copy of this District's Safe School Climate Plan shall be provided in written or electronic format to all District employees annually at the beginning of each school year.

B.  The District's Safe School Climate Plan shall be made available on the Board's website and on the website of each individual school with the District. Such posting shall occur within thirty \(30\) days of the approval of such plan by the State Department of Education \(Note: The Safe School Climate Plan must be approved by the Board of Education not later than January 1, 2012 and submitted to the State Department of Education.\)

C.  The District's Safe School Climate Plan shall be included in the District's publication of the rules, procedures and standards of conduct for schools and in all student handbooks.

### IX.  School Climate Assessments

A.  On or after July 1, 2012, and biennially thereafter, the Board requires each school within the District to complete an assessment using the school climate assessment instruments, including uniform surveys that collect information about students' perspectives and opinions about the school climate at the school and allow students to complete and submit such surveys anonymously, approved and disseminated by the State Department of Education.

B.  Completed assessments shall be shared with the Board and then submitted by the Board to the State Department of Education.

### X.  Bullying Through the Use of Technology \(Cyberbullying\)

An emerging form of bullying is the use of technology to threaten, intimidate, ridicule, humiliate, insult, or harass. Technology enables aggressive expression toward others and does not rely on physical strength or physical contact. By using a cell phone or the Internet, a student can quickly and aggressively spread rumors, threats, hate mail, or embarrassing photos through text messages, e-mails, or instant messages.

There are a number of social networking sites \(MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\) available to our students that can be misused and/or abused for bullying purposes. Any alleged misuse or abuse must be reported to any staff member or the Safe School Climate Specialist.

The District's discipline policy states that misuse, on or off campus, of electronic devices, for threatening/bullying/hazing or harassment is a violation and can be the basis for discipline on or off campus. When information is received that a student or students are involved in bullying through the use of technology either as the actor or a member of a group, or the victim, the following will be considered:

* If it takes place on campus or at a school-sponsored event, disciplinary action will be taken.

* If it takes place off campus a school may take disciplinary action if the incident poses a likelihood of substantial disruption to the educational process or the orderly day- to- day operations of the school.


### XI.  Relationship to Other Laws

A.  Consistent with state and federal laws, and the policies of the district and school rules, no person shall be discriminated against in admission to a public school of any town or in obtaining the advantages, privilege and courses of study of such public school on account of race, color gender, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation. Nothing in the "Plan" prevents the school or district from taking action to remediate discrimination or harassment based on a person's membership in a legally protected category under local, state, or federal law, or district policies.

B.  In addition, nothing in the "Plan" is designed or intended to limit the authority of the school or district to take disciplinary action under applicable laws, or local school or District policies in response to violent, harmful, or disruptive behavior, regardless of whether the "Plan" covers the behavior.

### XII.  Immunity for Board of Education, School Employees, Others

Members of the Board of Education and school employees are protected by statute against damage claims in the implementation of a safe school climate plan and, in accordance with a school district safe school climate plan, report, investigate, or respond to bullying. PA 11-232 also extends this immunity to reports of bullying incidents by parents, students, and others to a school employee according to a safe school climate plan.

To be immune, these parties must act in good faith and, in the case of a school employee or Board of Education, within the scope of their duties. The immunity does not cover gross, wanton, reckless, or willful misconduct.

**Regulation approved:  October 8, 2014**
