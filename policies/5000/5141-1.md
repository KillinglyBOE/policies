## 5141.1 - Accidents/Illness

All accidents occurring in the Killingly High School or on the grounds must be reported to the school nurse.

Students who become ill should obtain a pass to see the nurse from the teacher in charge. If, in the opinion of the nurse, the student is too ill to remain in school, the parents will be notified. Because it is usually considered inadvisable for a student to walk home, the parents will be asked to provide transportation. If a student is ill and must leave class or does not feel well enough to attend class, he/she MUST report to the nurse. Student may not leave the building.
