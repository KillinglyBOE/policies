## 5141.221 Appendix - Connecticut Department of Public Health: Head Lice - Fact Sheet

1.  What are head lice?

  Head lice are blood sucking parasites. They are approximately the size of a sesame seed, 1-2 mm. They do not have wings and, therefore, cannot fly. They also do not jump. They do, however, move quickly. The eggs of the louse, which are called "nits", are teardrop shaped and approximately half the size of the adult louse. The nits are attached to the hair shaft with a waterproof, cement-like substance from the adult female. Thus, nits cannot be simply washed or brushed out of the hair.

2.  Who can get head lice?

  Anyone who comes in contact with louse infested items can get head lice. Some people think lice become established on persons who are unclean. This is not true. Frequent bathing will neither prevent head lice nor eliminate an infestation once it has become established.

3.  How are head lice spread?

  Head lice are usually transmitted through close personal contact with another infested individual or through use of common combs, brushes, and other grooming aids; through sharing hats, caps, and coats; or through co-mingling of these items at the homes of friends, at school, at church, or other public places.

4.  What are the symptoms of head lice?

  The major symptom of head lice is itching, which is due to the presence of salivary fluid produced by the insect as it feeds.

5.  How do you eliminate head lice?

  Treatment is directed at the infested individual and his personal articles (e.g., caps, combs, brushes, towels, and bedding). Fumigation or use of insecticides in the home, school, or school buses is not recommended.

  A.  Individual Treatment

  Individual treatment usually requires using an over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication and a nit (head lice egg) comb.

  > Warning: Do not use a creme rinse or combination shampoo/conditioner before using lice medicine. Do not re-wash hair for 1-2 days after treatment.

  Follow these treatment steps:

  * Before application of the OTC or prescription treatment, remove all clothing from the waist up.

  * Apply the lice medicine according to label instructions. If your child has hair longer than shoulder length, you may need to use two bottles. It is important to pay special attention to instructions on the bottle regarding how long the medication should be left on and whether rinsing the hair is recommended after treatment.

  * After treatment, have the infested person put on clean clothing.

  * Nit combs, often found in lice medicine packages, should be used to comb nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective.

  * After treatment, check the hair every 2-3 days, and comb with a nit comb to remove nits and lice as necessary. Continue to check for 2-3 weeks until you are sure all lice and nits are gone.

  * If an OTC medicine was used, retreat in 7-10 days. If the prescription drug malathion was used, retreat in 7-10 days ONLY if crawling bugs are found.

  B.  Decontamination of Personal Articles and Environment

  Treat the household: If head lice fall off of a person and cannot feed, they will not survive very long. It is not necessary to spend a lot of time or money on housecleaning activities. You can help avoid re-infestation by lice that may have recently fallen off the hair or crawled onto clothing or furniture by following these steps.

  1.  To kill lice and nits, all washable clothing and bed linens that the infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment should be machine washed in hot water (130°F).  After the hot wash, the laundry should be dried at high heat for at least 20 minutes.

  2.  For clothing that is not washable, have it dry cleaned. (e.g., coats, hats, scarves).

  3.  All clothing, stuffed animals, comforters, etc. that cannot be washed or dry cleaned can be stored for 2 weeks in a plastic bag that is sealed with tape.

  4.  Combs and brushes can be soaked for 1 hour in rubbing alcohol, Lysol\*, or wash with soap and hot (130°F) water.

  5.  Vacuum the floor and furniture. There is a small risk of getting re-infested from a louse that has fallen onto the carpet or onto a sofa. Vacuum the places where the infested person usually sits or lays, spending a lot of time on this is not necessary. Do not use fumigant sprays; they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.

  C.  Prevent Re-infestation

  The most common way to spread lice is through direct head-to-head contact. It is less likely for lice to spread by crawling onto clothing or belongings. To control head lice outbreaks in a community, school or camp setting, children can be taught to avoid activities that are likely to spread lice.

  1.  Avoid head-to-head contact during play at school and at home (on a playground, sleep over party, camp, sports outing).

  2.  Do not share any items that may have had contact with someone else's head (e.g., hats, scarves, hair ribbons, coats, sports uniforms).

  3.  Do not share combs, brushes, or towels.

  4.  If you are aware that someone has a lice infestation, do not lie on the beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that the infested person may have had contact with.

### Pediculosis Guidelines - Identification

If a teacher or other school employee views the following symptoms, the student is to be referred to the school nurse or school health aide for a pediculosis screening.

A.  Excessive scratching of the scalp.

B.  Observation of nits (ivory colored eggs approximately 1/32 inch in length) or lice in hair.

### Procedures Regarding Individual Students

1.  If live lice or nits appearing in close proximity to scalp (1/4 inch or less) are observed the student is to be considered to have pediculosis. In this situation the school nurse is to notify the parent/guardian and instruct them on treatment procedures and precautions to prevent spreading. Head checks for the presence of lice will be conducted outside the classroom to maintain student privacy and minimize disruption of the educational process. The nurse will notify the classroom teacher and advise as to proper precautions to prevent further spread of the infestation. The student is not to use any shared headphones, helmets, hats or clothing.

2.  The nurse or school aide will do head checks on any students who are siblings of the infested student. Examination consists of sectioning and parting of hair using wooden applicator sticks.  (Alternate language: If a case of head lice is confirmed, the school nurse may conduct a classroom check or will check individual students as deemed necessary.) If the student has siblings in other schools, the nurse will notify the school nurse of that school so that the sibling may be screened

  If the infested student is in prekindergarten or elementary school grades, the nurse may screen the student's classmates.

3.  Identified students may return to school immediately following treatment which includes the application of head louse shampoo

  Additional language to consider:  It is the parent's/guardian's responsibility to treat the infested student at home and to accompany the student to school the next day. The school nurse will examine the student and readmit the student to school if no active infestation is present. If the examination discloses an active infestation, the parent/guardian will take the student home for further treatment. An infested student will be excluded from school until proper treatment has been completed

  Optional language: Only one day will be allowed as an excused absence for the purpose of treatment. Additional time out-of-school than this will be considered unexcused absence.

  Optional language: Only one day will be allowed as an excused absence for the purpose of treatment. Additional time out-of-school than this will be considered unexcused absences due to parental/guardian non-compliance and requires follow-up by the Principal or his/her designee.

4.  Identified students are to be rescreened seven to ten days after re-admittance to school.

5.  If there are nits which are not close to the scalp in a student's hair and there is a question as to whether there is a currently active infestation, implementation of the above-stated procedure will be strongly recommended to the parents. This is to be done in the best interest of the student and the school community.

6.  To ensure confidentiality, the names of the students who have pediculosis will not be shared with no other parents/guardians and will be shared with only those staff members who the Principal (or school nurse) deems to have a reason to know.

7.  If a student's pediculosis problem does not appear to be eliminated by the standard medical treatment, the school medical advisor will collaborate with the school Principal and school nurse to determine further treatment recommendations. The school nurse may, at his/her discretion exclude a student with repeated infestation of live lice or viable nits.

### Procedures Regarding the School Community

1.  If a count of active pediculosis cases exceeds ten percent (10%) of the school enrollment during a ten (10) calendar day period of time, the nurse or school health aide is to check the entire school. This decision is to be made by the school nurse and the school Principal with the recommendation of the School Medical Advisor.

2.  If a student has been declared an inactive case and becomes infected at another point in time, he or she will be reclassified as an unduplicated active case when the new one ten percent count is being calculated.

3.  The school Principal and nurse are to assess the extent of the problem and form a plan of action regarding notification of parents of non-afflicted students. If the nurse and the school Principal decide to inform parents of non involved students a letter similar to the attached example may be used (Sample letter for Notification of Pediculosis in School #5141.221 Form #1) (Alternate Language: The Principal may send a letter to parents/guardians within the classroom where two or more cases of head lice have been confirmed by the school nurse, notifying them of the cases of head lice if he/she deems it appropriate. The Principal, in consultation with the school nurse, may extend the communication of the presence of head lice to the entire school community at his/her discretion.) If it is decided that more information needs to be distributed or there is a second school wide screening, a mailer can be done which includes more specific information (Prevention and Control of Pediculosis 5141.221 Form #2)

### Pediculosis (Head Lice) Prevention Plan

1.  Educate staff, parents/guardians and students on ways to prevent head lice.

2.  Avoid stacking/piling or hanging coats on top of each other.

3.  Encourage students to keep hats and scarves in their coat sleeves.

4.  Remind students not to share combs, brushes, scrunchies, barrettes, hats and scarfs

5.  Avoid sharing earphones and helmets.

6.  Watch for signs such as frequent head scratching.

7.  Encourage families to inform any of their children's contacts regarding exposure such as friends, overnight guests, relatives, and sports teams (especially those teams that share hats or helmets).

8.  Families who require repeated treatment should consult with their family physician.
