## 5141.23 - Students with Special Health Care Needs

### General Statement of Policy

Students with health impairments have needs similar to those of students without such impairments.  For these students, access to education requires:

*  assessment and periodic reassessment of the child's health status and level of functioning on a daily or intermittent basis in order to determine what special services or program modifications he/she may need;

*  policies which support close collaboration with families;

*  safe professional practice;

*  appropriate instructional programs;

*  related services necessary to ensure successful functioning in educational settings;

*  enhanced communication and collaboration with health and social service providers in the community;

*  education of school personnel; and

*  smooth interdisciplinary teamwork

Recognizing the above, the Board of Education will adopt the State of Connecticut Department of Education Guidelines for Serving Students with Special Health Care Needs - 1992.  As it was intended that these guidelines be built upon to develop, enhance and promote safe and appropriate educational opportunities for students with special health care needs, amendments to these guidelines will be made as necessary, by the school nurses and the School Medical Advisor.

### Administrative Responsibility

The administration is responsible for notifying the school nurse that a student with special health care needs is entering or reentering the school, and to collaborate with the school nurse and other appropriate personnel to provide for the student's safe transition into school, and meeting his subsequent health care needs while in school.

General categories (with examples of each type) of students with special health care needs are as follows (this list is not inclusive):

*  Chronic Disease:  asthma, cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, seasonal respiratory allergies, sickle cell anemia

*  Chronic Infectious Disease:  hepatitis B infection, HIV infection, mononucleosis

*  Physical Conditions:  congenital heart defect, spina bifida

*  Psychological Condition:  childhood psychosis, chronic depression, conduct disorder

*  Acquired Disability:  traumatic brain injury, lead poisoning, drug addiction, broken leg

*  Severe Acute Illness:  (which may require complex medical care over several weeks or months) nephritis (kidney infection), osteomyelitis (bone infection), pneumonia (lung infection)

### School Nurse Responsibility

All students with special health care needs entering or reentering Killingly Public Schools will be assessed by the school nurse prior to entering or returning to school.  The school nurse will collaborate with any other appropriate personnel to develop a care plan for the student's safe transition into school and meeting his subsequent health care needs while in school.
