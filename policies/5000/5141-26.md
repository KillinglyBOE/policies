## 5141.26 - Emergency Situation With No Nurse in School

If a school nurse or School Medical Advisor is not readily available and the rendering of emergency first aid is necessary, other public school personnel who have completed a course in first aid offered by the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association, or the Connecticut Department of Health Services may render such emergency first aid to a child.  In accordance with state law, any person providing such aid is not liable for civil damages for any personal injuries which result from acts or omissions by such person rendering the emergency first aid, which constitute ordinary negligence.  The immunity does not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross, willful or wanton negligence.

Each building shall maintain and post a list of emergency response team and their extensions.
