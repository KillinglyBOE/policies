## 5145.8 - Emancipation of Minors/Age of Majority

### Age of Majority

All students who have reached the age of majority shall be considered students in the same manner as those under the age of eighteen (18).  The entire curriculum shall be available to them without special restrictions.  The student shall be governed by all regulations formulated for students and shall have equal opportunities to participate in extracurricular and other student activities as was the case prior to the enactment of the policy.

Inasmuch as a student at the age of eighteen (18) has legal control of himself/herself, policies and regulations which heretofore have referred to the parent or guardian will now in a legal sense refer to the student himself/herself.

Unless the school is officially instructed by the individual student who has reached the age of majority to do otherwise, the school will continue to keep the parent or guardian informed as is the case with all other students, so long as the student in question shall continue to reside in the home of the parent or guardian.  When a student at the age of eighteen (18) officially makes such a request as outlined above, the school shall so notify the parent or guardian in writing and shall comply with the written request of the student.
