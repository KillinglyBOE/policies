## 6000 - Concept and Roles In Instruction

### Instruction - General

The Board of Education believes the instructional program of the public schools to be among its highest priorities, and it is therefore important for the Board and the professional staff to work cooperatively in determining educational goals and objectives which meet the needs of students.

Within limitations of budgets made available to it by the Town, the Board of Education will provide personnel, equipment, instructional supplies and materials, and other support required to meet professional staff needs and community goals.  The Board, understanding that education requires continuing change, also supports continuing in-service education for certified and non-certified staff.

The Superintendent of Schools shall present regular evidence of student progress and of program modifications based on evaluations which are consistent with district goals and objectives.  Evidence of educational productivity is important in evaluating the educational system, for guiding improvement efforts, and in developing public support for the schools.

Finally, and of extreme importance, the Board of Education wishes to have the staff present it with evidence of achievement, or lack of achievement, of the students in the light of the schools’ goals and objectives. It is clear that evidence of the productivity of the schools is the Board of Education’s best device for evaluating the educational system, for guiding improvement efforts and for fostering approval of schools.
