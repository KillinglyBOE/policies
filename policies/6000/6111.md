## 6111 - School Calendar

The school calendar shall show the beginning and ending of school dates, legal and local holidays, orientation meeting days, number of teaching days, vacation periods and other pertinent dates.

The Board, in establishing a graduation date, may establish for any school year a firm graduation date which is no earlier than the one-hundred eighty-fifth day in the adopted school calendar.  The graduation date may be modified, if necessary, after April first in any school year by the Board establishing a firm graduation date which, at the time of such establishment, provides for at least 180 days of school.

The Board of Education may declare a holiday in the schools under its jurisdiction when good reason exists.
