## 6113 - Release Time

Students are to be excused from school upon written request from parent or guardian.  Students will be given the right to make up tests and will not be deprived of any awards.

The staff should cooperate fully with parents/guardians in requests for student absences for dental and medical services. Advance notification of such appointments and parental effort to schedule such appointments in free time or after school may be requested.

Principals and teachers shall continually emphasize that students should not be taken out of school unless absolutely necessary. Students’ and parents’ as well as teachers’ and administrators’ appointments can often be made after school or on Saturday. The idea that a student should attend school must become an imperative in his/her mind.
