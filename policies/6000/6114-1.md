In the event that fire is discovered in the school plant, the fire department shall be called immediately following giving the signal to evacuate the building.

The Principal shall hold at least one fire drill each month in which all students, teachers and other employees shall be required to leave the school building.

1. Students must leave the building in an orderly and rapid manner and teachers are required to check to ascertain that no student remains in the building.

2. Real emergencies often call for alternate exits to be used. Teachers must be prepared to select and direct their classes to these alternate exits in the event the designated escape route is blocked. This demands close control of students.

3. A record shall be kept in the Principalâ€™s office of each fire drill conducted. A copy of the record shall also be filed in the office of the Superintendent.


Principals and teachers shall recognize that the essential element in any emergency is prevention of panic. Principal and teachers shall afford students such confidence as clarity of direction and supervision can contribute.
