## 6122 - Comparability of Services

*  provide services with state and local funds in schools serving Chapter I project areas that are at least comparable to services in non-project areas.

*  use state and local funds to provide for an equivalence among all schools with the same grade levels in teachers, administrators, and auxiliary personnel.

*  use state and local funds to provide for an equivalence among all schools with the same grade levels in the provision of curriculum and instructional materials, books and supplies.
