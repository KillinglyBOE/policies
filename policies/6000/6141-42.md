## 6141.42 - Student Volunteers and Community Service

The district is committed to preparing its high school students for active participation in community affairs through a student service learning program.  Community service is defined as an activity that provides a valuable or needed service, the purpose of which is not to directly benefit self or family.

Through participation in student service learning, a student will have opportunities to:

*  Develop knowledge and respect for community and citizenship;

*  Learn that problems can be solved by working together;

*  Learn the responsibilities involved in citizenship;

*  Explore career opportunities;

*  Increase self-esteem and appreciation for others;

*  Become sensitive to others and appreciate cultural diversity;

*  Overcome barriers among children.

Effective with the Class of 2008, community service is required for all students.  All graduating students will have completed a minimum of forty (40) hours of community service.  The forty hours may be obtained through service to a variety of non-profit groups, community organizations, individuals, and/or school activities.  This community service requirement can be met anytime after the first day of school in grade 9 and prior to May 15th of the senior year.  An alternate plan shall be provided for those students with parent approval who cannot do community service for moral, ethical, religious, physical or other reasons.

I, _____________________________________________ understand clearly that I must complete 40 hours

                                  (student’s name)

of community service in  order to satisfy the Community Service Performance Graduation Requirement. I understand that each community service activity must be a minimum of 3 hours and need not be served at one time. Activities may be completed anytime after the first day of school in grade 9 and prior to May 15th of the senior year. I also understand that I must transport myself to a volunteer site at my expense. If applicable, I agree to adhere to the organization(s) regulations, policies and procedures concerning hours, personal appearance, general decorum and office practice.

  I understand I may not participate in any activity involving the use of dangerous or potentially dangerous tools and/or equipment.

  I understand I may not operate a motor vehicle while performing community service.

  I understand I may not transport individuals in a motor vehicle as part of my community service experience.

  I understand I must call the site in advance of a scheduled service if detainment or the need to be absent occurs.

I understand that any misconduct will result in school disciplinary measures and/or failure to meet graduation requirements and that any unsatisfactory performance will result in failure to meet graduation requirements. In so doing, I place myself in an ineligible status for graduation until I satisfactorily complete the Community Service PGR.

I hereby accept full responsibility for my behavior and clearly understand Killingly High School’s expectations and guidelines and shall govern myself accordingly.
