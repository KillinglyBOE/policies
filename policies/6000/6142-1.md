Helping students attain a mature and responsible attitude toward human sexuality is a continuous task of every generation.

The schools should support and supplement parents' efforts in the areas of family life and sex education by offering students factual information and opportunities to discuss concerns, issues and attitudes inherent in family life and sexual behavior.

Students and parents or guardians shall be informed of their right to exempt the student from the family life program.
