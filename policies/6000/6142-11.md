## 6141.11 - Human Relations Education

The Board affirms its responsibility to assume a leadership role in affecting community attitudes in relation to our society's needs.  A vital part of this endeavor is the creation of a climate within the schools which enhances the dignity and importance of each individual.  Equally important is the strengthening of steps which have been taken to promote a feeling of understanding, trust, and acceptance among persons of differing races, colors creeds, and backgrounds.

In order to develop these attitudes in our school children, the Board intends:

1.  To emphasize human relationship and intergroup relations as an essential part of teacher in-service and other employee training programs.

2.  To develop curricula which uses every opportunity to present the many ethnic, racial, and religious strands that are a part of the American fabric.
