## 6142.2 - Reading/Language Arts

Reading and language skills are integral parts of all phases of the learning process. Each individual, therefore must learn to speak, read, write, and listen to words in order to function effectively in school and society. Since it is primarily with words that ideas and thoughts are communicated, it is imperative that the individuals develop competency in the reading and language arts areas for self-fulfillment, effective communication, creative expression, and to assume a productive role in society. Each individual must be provided with an educational program at his or her level of ability and achievement. Such a program will emphasize the differentiation of instruction, flexible grouping, and a multi-modality approach.

Recognizing the importance of establishing the appropriate foundation during the primary grades and its statutory requirements, the Board of Education, by September 1, 1999 will develop and implement a three year plan to improve the reading skills of students in grades K through 3 inclusive. The goal of such plan is to have all students attain the stateâ€™s reading competency standard.

### K-3: Literacy Development

The Superintendent is directed by the Board of Education to develop a plan whose goal is to have all students attain the district's reading and writing competency standards. The Superintendent is directed to include in the programs:
