## 6146 - Graduation Requirements

Graduation from our public schools implies that students (1) have satisfactorily completed the prescribed courses of study for the several grade levels in accordance with their respective abilities to achieve, (2) have satisfactorily passed any examinations and/or standards established by the faculty and approved by the Board of Education, (3) that they have the legally mandated number and distribution of credits and (4) have satisfactorily completed all performance graduation requirements.

It is expected that the faculty will apply measures of achievement to provide evidence that each student has progressed far enough toward school goals to warrant graduation according to the terms of paragraph #1 above.

The Board of Education - in recognition of its responsibility for the education of all youths in the school system, including those who drop out of school - may make available to all the school system’s youths alternative programs for meeting standards that will enable them to acquire a high school or vocational school diploma.
