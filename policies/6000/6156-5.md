### Lesson Plans

Each teacher is expected to keep a detailed plan of all classes in a plan book or other satisfactory method.  Tentative outlines of class work should be prepared one week in advance and should be readily available for a substitute in the event of absence.  Plan books should be in use whenever the teacher is teaching a class.  An accurate up-to-date list of class membership with seating plan should be kept in the book.  Schedule of classes, bell schedule, name of textbooks used, as well as other information helpful to a substitute teacher should be readily available.
