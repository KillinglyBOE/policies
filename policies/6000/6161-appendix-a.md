## 6161 Appendix A - Selection Policy For School Library Media Center Collections

School Library Media Specialists are responsible for the review, evaluation, and selection of the school library media collection. School Library Media Specialists work cooperatively with administrators and teachers to provide resources which represent diverse points of view, stimulate growth in thinking skills, and promote the overall educational program. Library media collections are developed to meet both curricular and personal needs. To ensure that these needs are met, Library Media Specialists apply selection criteria and use recommended selection tools. All purchases, including gifts, shall meet the same selection standards.

This selection policy reflects the philosophy and goals of the school system and supports the principles of intellectual freedom described in Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, the Library Bill of Rights (ALA), Students' Right to Read (NCTE), and other statements on intellectual freedom from the American Library Association and the American Association of School Librarians.

### Selection Criteria for Library Media Materials

* Appropriate for recommended levels

  Library media materials shall be accessible to students of varied abilities, and meet informational and interest needs of all students.

* Pertinent to the curriculum and the objectives of the instructional program

  Library media materials shall be selected on the basis of assessed curricular needs. Materials shall reflect the identified learning outcomes of the instructional program.

* Accurate in terms of content

  Library media materials shall present facts in an objective manner. Authority of the author, organization, publisher/producer shall be a consideration in selection. Materials concerning human development and family life shall contain facts which are presented in a manner appropriate to the level of the students.

* Reflective of the pluralistic nature of a global society

  Library media materials shall provide a global perspective and promote diversity as a positive attribute of our society. It is important to include materials by authors and illustrators of all cultures.

* Free of bias and stereotype

  Materials shall reflect the basic humanity of all people and be free of stereotypes, caricatures, distorted dialect, sexual bias, and other offensive characteristics. Library materials concerning religious, social, and political content shall inform rather than indoctrinate.

* Representative of differing viewpoints on controversial subjects

  Students have the right to information on both sides of a controversial issue. By having access to a variety of resources students will have the knowledge base to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. The school library media center provides free and equitable access to all information.

* Appropriate format to effectively teach the curriculum

  Library media materials shall be available in variety of formats, e.g., print, non-print, electronic, multimedia, to meet the needs and learning styles of a diverse student population.

* Recent copyright date as appropriate to the subject

  Library media materials shall be assessed for currency of the information as it relates to the content and purpose of the item.

* Acceptable in literary style and technical quality

  Literary quality, technical merit, physical arrangement, and aesthetic characteristics shall be considered as integral components in the evaluation of all media formats.

* Cost effective in terms of use

  Library media materials shall be evaluated for cost effectiveness in terms of accessibility, projected use, and durability.

* Appropriate for students with special needs

  Library media materials shall be provided to meet curricular needs and the individual needs, interests, and learning styles of all students at all levels.

### Implementing the Selection Policy

The objective of the selection policy is to increase the awareness of educators of the many considerations one must apply when making decisions about information resources available to students and teachers. The proliferation of knowledge as characteristic of the “Information Age” brings with it many challenges. According to John Naisbitt, "We have for the first time an economy based on a key resource (information) that is not only renewable, but self generating. Running out of information is not a problem, but drowning in it is."

Library media specialists play a leadership role in communicating to the educational community the purpose and scope of the selection policy. The responsibility for coordinating the selection of library materials rests with the library media specialist who seeks faculty, student, and parent recommendations for purchase of library media materials. Favorable reviews from professional review journals and authoritative selection references shall be used when developing library media collections. Wherever possible, direct examination of materials is advisable to ensure that they meet selection criteria.
