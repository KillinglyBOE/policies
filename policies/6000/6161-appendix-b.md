## 6161 Appendix B - Essential Curriculum and Collection Development

The major emphasis of collection development shall be to provide materials which meet curricular needs. It is recommended that a copy of each curriculum guide be housed in the library media center. The library media specialist needs to be familiar with changes and additions to the curriculum and how they effect collection development.

### Teacher Recommendations

Communication with teachers to assess curriculum needs and recommendations for purchase is an important part of the selection process. Since the library media collection is an integral part of the instructional and learning process, the strength and value of the collection are ensured when teachers are actively involved in the selection process. A sample form is included at the end of this document.

### Student and Parent Recommendations

Suggestions from students and parents is also an important part of the selection process. As students seek information for curricular purposes or use the library media center for personal interests, students and parents are encouraged to make recommendations of specific resources or subject areas where information is needed. A sample form is included at the end of this document.

### Professional Review Journals

The following professional review journals are some recommended selection tools:

*  The Book Report

*  Booklinks

*  Booklist

*  Bulletin of Center for Children's Books

*  CD-ROM Professional

*  Classroom Connect

*  Horn Book

*  Information Searcher

*  Internet World

*  Library Talk

*  Multicultural Book Reviews for K-12 Educators

*  School Library Journal

*  School Library Media Activities Monthly

### Core Collection Tools

Core collection tools are authoritative selection references to help assess the quality of the media collection and the availability of resources from various publishers/producers. Unlike review journals which are published monthly/bi-monthly, core collection references are updated annually.

*  Children's Catalog

*  Elementary School Library Collection

*  Junior High School Catalog

*  Senior High School Catalog

### Vendor Catalogs

Publisher and jobber catalogs can be useful in preparing orders and determining the availability of materials. It is recommended that a Publisher & Producer file be kept only for those catalogs which are most useful and appropriate for the collection. Some catalogs list review sources, but they may not necessarily be positive ones. Also, some jobbers will prepare upon request subject specific bibliographies of materials, e.g., multicultural with reference to reviews. These lists can be used to facilitate preparation of purchase requisitions. The library media specialist shall keep in mind that these are marketing tools, not selection tools.

### Considerations For Selection of Print Materials

There are general selection criteria which apply to all library media materials. The following media formats require additional considerations.

### Books

Due to the high cost of materials, it is important to examine books with the following additional criteria in mind before purchasing:

*  Illustrations and layout

*  Type style and text density

*  Paper quality

*  Durability of bindings

*  Readability and interests levels

*  Indexing

### Paperbacks

Paperbacks are an inexpensive way to supplement the library media collection for duplication of titles, in-depth studies, special projects, and leisure reading.  It is recommended that first copies of picture books be hardcover.

When deciding whether to purchase paperback books or hardbound books consider the following:

*  Curricular demand placed on these books in the individual school

*  Use of these materials for research, independent reading, duplication of classics, and popular fiction

*  Cost and use of paperback books as compared to the cost of hardback books

### Periodicals

Periodicals support the curriculum and provide leisure reading for students. Professional review journals and library periodicals for instruction may be considered for purchase. Consider access to full text online periodical databases.

### Newspapers

Newspapers may be ordered as needed. Consider access to full text online newspaper databases.

### Pamphlets

Pamphlets that support the curriculum may be added to the collection. It is recommended that they be organized in an information file by subject rather than fully cataloged. Apply general selection criteria.

### Reference

Reference materials in both print and electronic formats provide comprehensive information in both general and subject-specific areas. They also serve as access tools to information from other sources including school, public, academic, and electronic collections.

The following points need to be considered:

*  Cost effective in terms of projected use

*  Authority

*  Arrangement and indexing

*  User-friendly

### Selection of Non-Print Instructional Materials

#### Considerations for Selection of Non-print Materials

The criteria for selection of non-print materials are essentially the same as for print materials. The quality of auditory and visual presentation shall be considered as well as accuracy of information and the appropriateness of format.

Non-print materials shall:

*  Promote instructional goals and support the curriculum

*  Provide a variety of media formats to meet the needs of the curriculum

*  Present content in appropriate format and acceptable technical quality

*  Avoid dense text and graphics

#### Considerations for Selection of Electronic Resources

The criteria for selection of electronic resources are essentially the same as for print materials. Electronic resources such as CD-ROM, computer software, and online services provide greater access to information. Availability of network versions and site license agreements may be a factor in selection.

Electronic resources shall:

*  Provide learner control through flexible pacing, variable difficulty, and optimal branching and linking

*  Information is accurate and reliably maintained

*  Organization, searching capabilities, and navigation tools enhance information retrieval

*  Provide record keeping and management options, if applicable

*  Provide readable text, attractive graphics, and an appealing layout

*  Have easy-to-understand, comprehensive documentation

*  User friendly

### Collection Development

The school library media program is an integral part of the instructional process. As part of the instructional process, the collection development is based upon the belief that all students, teachers, administrators, and support staff shall have open access to all forms of information relevant to learning and teaching the curriculum. To ensure access to quality library media collections, a systematic process for assessing and building library media collections is essential.

Collection development is the ongoing process of identifying strengths and weaknesses of library media collections in terms of student needs. Collection development demonstrates that funds are being spent wisely and that library media collections meet the informational needs of the curriculum as well as independent reading and viewing needs of students. The three components involved in the collection development process are:

### Analysis of the School Community

In order to be responsive to the unique needs of each school, a collection development process must be based upon an analysis of student needs at that particular school. There will be some similarities among library media collections across the system, but the profile provided by this analysis will ensure that the specific needs of each school are addressed.

### Assessment of the Library Media Collection

Collection assessment is needed to determine the quality of the existing library media collection. It is an organized method for collecting statistics on the age of the collection, the number of titles in the collection, and the ability of the collection to meet curricular needs.

### Selection and Acquisition of Materials

The selection and acquisition of new library media materials will be based upon the needs of each library media center as determined by the collection assessment process and upon the availability of funding. The Board policy shall be followed when selecting all library media materials.

### Assessment and Inventory Process

An essential step in collection development is assessment of the needs of the curriculum and student population with regard to library media resources. Library media specialists will develop yearly and long-range plans to assist in ongoing assessment.

Assessment of the collection includes taking inventory of existing materials, assessing materials in relation to needs of instructional units, and weeding outdated and inappropriate materials.

The inventory is a process by which holdings are checked against the conventional or automated cataloging system and the actual item to determine if the resource is still part of the collection and still meets selection criteria. The objective of this inventory is to ensure that the cataloging system accurately reflects the collection which is the key access point for students and teachers to locate information within the library. This procedure shall not disrupt the library media program. Some library media specialists may prefer to complete an inventory annually; others may prefer to use a two or three-year cycle.

### Consideration File

Library media specialists shall maintain a Consideration File for future purchases. This file shall reflect school needs, staff recommendations, and reviews. Create a database to input ordering information for resources which are recommended for purchase and to output a list of resources to order. Some suggested database fields are: Title, author, publisher, copyright, review source, price.
