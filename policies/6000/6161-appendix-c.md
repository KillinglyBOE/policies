## 6161 Appendix C - Deselection (Weeding) Policy For School Library Media Center Collections

### Weeding of Materials

The Public Schools maintains an active policy of withdrawal based on the elimination of outdated material, books no longer of interest or in demand, duplicates, and worn or mutilated copies. Frequency of circulation, community interest, and availability of newer and more valid materials are of prime consideration. Local history, genealogy, and material of local industry are an exception. Fiction, once popular, but no longer in demand, is discarded as are nonfiction books which were purchased to meet demands no longer existing.

Systematic weeding of the collection is required of every Library Media Specialist in order to keep the collection responsive to patrons' needs, to insure its vitality and usefulness to the school community, and to make room for newer materials. Weeding identifies damaged items, ephemeral materials which are no longer used, out-of-date materials, and extra copies which are not being used. Weeding also helps the Library Media Specialist evaluate the collection by identifying areas or titles where additional materials are needed, older editions that need to be updated, and subjects, titles, or authors that are no longer of interest to the community. If a Library Media Specialist is uncertain about a title to be withdrawn, standard bibliographic tools in the subject will be consulted to see if the title has historical or literary value.

### Guidelines

*  **Record of use**: has the item circulated in the past five years? Shelf-time periods (or the length of time an item remains on the shelf between circulations) can reflect a declining or non-existent pattern of use. Remember that seasonal, monthly or some similar patterns of use exist in school libraries and these patterns must be taken into consideration when establishing shelf-time and cut-off periods for weeding. Many consider the shelf-period criterion to be accurate, valid, and by far the best since it does not reduce circulation.

*  **Currency of content**: Is the subject matter out-of-date, factually inaccurate, or no longer relevant to the educational program? Are illustrations outmoded; or do they perpetuate sexual, racial, or cultural stereotypes? Has the material been superseded by better or more up-to-date materials, even though it is only a year or two old? Has the curriculum changed to the point where the material is no longer pertinent? Is it obsolete in content, style, or theme? Is the approach no longer appropriate (word choice and style of writing of a generation or two ago leave today's youngsters guessing instead of helping them to understand)?

*  **Technical quality**: in non-print materials, are visuals poor, faded, off color, or scratched; if black and white, have they been superseded by a clear color edition? Are sound reproductions faulty or inferior?

*  **Physical condition**: is it worn, torn, soiled, or generally ragged? Are pages or parts missing? Do the pages have very fine print or yellowed paper? Classics with such make-up have no place on school library shelves. Weigh the cost of repairing and rebinding against the cost of replacement. Better no mending than poor mending as any mending takes time and care, plus supplies.

*  **Dispensability**: is it a duplicate copy? Does it duplicate materials no longer needed in the collection? If a textbook, is it no longer useful for reference?

To indicate when an item should be removed from the collection, use the acronym MUSTY:

*  **M**  Misleading and/or factually inaccurate

*  **U**  Ugly-worn, and beyond mending or rebinding

*  **S**  Superseded by a truly NEW edition or by a much better book

*  **T**  Trivial-of no discernible literary or scientific value

*  **Y**  Your collection has no use for this material, irrelevant to the needs of your community

*  **What not to weed.** There are also valid reasons for NOT discarding materials even if the above criteria are met.

*  It is a work of historical significance in the field of children's literature.

*  It has unusual illustrations, or illustrations done by a well-known artist.

*  It is a work by a local author, illustrator, or editor

*  It describes local history or personalities.

*  It is a memorial gift.

*  It bears a significant relationship to other materials on the same subject.

*  There is little or no money available for more satisfactory titles.

*  It has possible usefulness to some special group or individual in the school.
