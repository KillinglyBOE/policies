## 6164.12 - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a serious health problem in the United States. Currently there is no cure for AIDS. The Killingly Board of Education advocates that education about AIDS should be provided to students and that it be presented in a societal context. Specifically, students should be encouraged and instructed in how to make decisions to protect their own health as well as their responsibility to minimize the transmission of the disease. Further, the Board supports the public health community's position that sexual abstinence is the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS. In addition, the Board believes that sexual abstinence protects the student psychologically from the stress of adult decision making during adolescence.

The Board hopes that parents will join in partnership with the schools in conveying health information and sound decision making to the children of Killingly. For those parents who wish to handle these topics without the involvement of the schools, the administration will inform parent(s), guardian(s) of their right to have their child(ren) excluded from AIDS instruction. The request must be presented to the Principal in writing.
