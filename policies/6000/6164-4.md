## 6164.4 - Identification of Special Needs and Abilities

The Board of Education recognizes that each student is a unique individual, and that while for most students the conventional school program is appropriate, a substantial number of students have exceptional needs.

The Board of Education therefore directs the Superintendent to develop and implement regulations and procedures which will serve to seek out all individuals with exceptional needs residing in the school district who are eligible for "free appropriate public education."

The Superintendent is also directed to develop an assessment plan for the assessment and evaluation of the exceptional needs of each individual identified in the search.  The assessment plan shall be a description in ordinary language of the procedures, tests, records, or reports proposed for use in the assessment of the individual.

The search and assessment plans shall be in accordance with the provisions of federal and state laws and regulations.
