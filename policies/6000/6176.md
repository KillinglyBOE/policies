## 6176 - Career and Vocational Education

The Board of Education believes that constructive attitudes and concepts involving the dignity of all kinds of work should be woven into existing curriculum, commencing with the beginning grades. Educational programs shall continuously expose students to the nature of a wide variety of careers in the world of work. Occupational education shall be geared to take into account technical and economic conditions and changes, and, as a core component of comprehensive education, shall share other aspects of the curriculum for the purpose of development of character and attitudes as well as skills. Guidance and counseling services shall be provided each student throughout his/her academic program.

The Board of Education directs the administration to offer a planned, ongoing and systematic program of instruction in career education and, at least on the secondary level, in vocational education.
