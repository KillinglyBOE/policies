## 9010 - Limits of Authority

The Board of Education is the unit of authority. Apart from their function as part of the unit, the Board member has no individual authority. Individually the Board member may not commit the district to any policy, act or expenditure. The Board member cannot do business with the district served, nor should the Board member have an interest in any contract with the school system in general except on a competitive bid or competitive quotation basis.  No Board member shall participate in any discussion, debate or vote on a contract for which he/she has a potential interest.  The Board member does not represent a factional segment of the community, but is rather a part of the body which represents and acts for the community as a whole.

No individual member of the Board, by virtue of holding office, shall exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools, nor as an individual command the services of any school employee.

No member of the Board of Education shall be asked to perform any routine or clerical duties which may be assigned to an employee.
