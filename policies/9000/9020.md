## 9020 - Public Statements

The Killingly Board of Education recognizes that communication is a continuous two-way process. The Board believes that it is important to keep the public informed about educational programs, and, in turn, that the community should have the opportunity to provide input.

Communication will be a concurrent responsibility of the Board of Education and the Superintendent of Schools. The Superintendent of Schools will work with the members of the Board of Education to conduct an active and comprehensive program throughout the school district and community for the prompt dissemination of information about decisions made at all Board meetings. Brief summaries of Board meeting minutes prepared for distribution are regarded as appropriate media of information for meeting the requirements of this bylaw. Press releases relative to Board of Education action shall be released only by the Board Chairperson or the delegated agent of the Board.
