### Negotiations

The Board of Education designates the Superintendent of Schools as the official representative of the Board on matters of common concern, as determined by the Board as being negotiable, in the preliminary stages of negotiations.  However, the final decision on any matter and/or problem of common concern, considered by the Board as negotiable, shall be made by the Board.  One or more members of the administrative staff may also be appointed to serve on the Boardâ€™s negotiating committee.

It is the policy of the Board to hire a consultant to serve as chief negotiator in negotiations with the professional staff.
