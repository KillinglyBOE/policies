### Consent Agenda

To make more efficient use of meeting time, the Board of Education authorizes the use of a consent agenda as part of its regular meeting agenda.  The consent agenda will condense the routine business of the Board (e.g., approving Board minutes, reviewing monthly expenses) into either a single motion or several categorical motions.

The consent agenda will be prepared by the Superintendent of Schools in consultation with the Chairperson of the Board.

Items on a consent agenda will not be discussed prior to action.  However, if any Board member believes that any item on the consent agenda requires discussion, that Board member may remove the item from the consent agenda merely by requesting same.  The exempted item then moves to the regular agenda, and the Board may take action as it deems appropriate.  All non-exempted items will be moved, seconded, and voted upon either in one motion or in several categorical motions without discussion.
