### Chapter 46: STATE APPOINTIVE OFFICERS

#### Section 4-1: Appointed officers; term; compensation and expenses.

Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, each person appointed or nominated for appointment by the Governor, with or without the advice and consent of the General Assembly or either house thereof, and each person appointed or elected by the General Assembly or either house thereof, shall be sworn and shall hold office for the term prescribed by law and until his successor is appointed and has qualified. Such persons shall receive no compensation for services unless the same is prescribed by law, but shall receive their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.

**(1949 Rev., S. 260.)**

*Section is effective amendment of statutes not specifically providing for extension of term in case of failure of appointment of successor, and incumbent will hold over de jure. 133 C. 40. See 133 C. 50. Can be interpreted only as effective to fix a term of office ab initio. 135 C. 639. Is a remedial statute which should receive as liberal a construction as can reasonably be given to effectuate its beneficial purpose. 136 C. 312. The term of office of a municipal court judge is “otherwise specifically provided by law” by the twentieth amendment; doubtful that statute was intended to apply to judicial offices. 138 C. 153. Cited. 200 C. 91.Declaratory judgment not appropriate to try title to office. 13 CS 430. Where General Assembly did not appoint a county commissioner, the incumbent held over and an interim appointment was invalid. 14 CS 225.*

#### Section 4-1a: Appointed officers, unspecified terms.

**(P.A. 73-659; P.A. 89-87, S. 3, 5.)**

> History: P.A. 89-87 added provision to include, as an appointed official of the state, any person appointed to a board, commission, council, authority, task force, committee or other body.

(b) Moneys in said Budget Reserve Fund shall be expended only as provided in this subsection. When in any fiscal year the Comptroller has determined the amount of a deficit applicable with respect to the immediately preceding fiscal year, to the extent necessary, the amount of funds credited to said Budget Reserve Fund shall be deemed to be appropriated for purposes of funding such deficit.

(c) The Treasurer is authorized to invest all or any part of said fund in accordance with the provisions of section 3-31a. The interest derived from the investment of said fund shall be credited to the General Fund.

No action on a claim under such contract shall be brought except within the period which commences with the execution of the contract or the authorized commencement of work on the contract project, whichever is earlier, and which ends three years after the acceptance of the work by the agency head of the department administering the contract evidenced by a certificate of acceptance issued to the contractor or three years after the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier. Issuance of such certificate of acceptance shall not be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action. Acceptance of an amount offered as final payment shall not preclude any person, firm or corporation from bringing a claim under this section. Such action shall be tried to the court without a jury. All legal defenses except governmental immunity shall be reserved to the state. In no event shall interest be awarded under section 13a-96 and section 37-3a by a court or an arbitrator to the claimant for the same debt for the same period of time. Interest under section 37-3a shall not begin to accrue to a claimant under this section until at least thirty days after the claimant submits a bill or claim to the agency for the unpaid debt upon which such interest is to be based, along with appropriate documentation of the debt when applicable.

Issuance of such certificate of acceptance shall not be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action.

(c) Once a notice of claim is given to the agency head as required by subsection (b) of this section, each party shall allow the other to examine and copy any nonprivileged documents which may be relevant either to the claimant’s claims or to the state’s defenses to such claims. Requests to examine and copy documents which have been prepared by the contractor in order to submit a bid shall be subject to a claim of privilege and grounds for an application to any court or judge pursuant to section 52-415 for a decision on whether such documents constitute trade secrets or other confidential research, development or commercial information and whether such documents shall not be disclosed to the state or shall be disclosed to the state only in a designated way. Any such documents for which no decision is sought or privilege obtained shall not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210 and shall not be disclosed by the agency to any person or agency that is not a party to the arbitration. Such documents shall be used only for settlement or litigation of the parties’ claims. The arbitrators shall determine any issue of relevance of such documents after an in camera inspection. The arbitrators shall seal such documents during arbitration and shall return such documents to the claimant after final disposition of the claim.

(d) Hearings shall be scheduled for arbitration in a manner that shall ensure that each party shall have reasonable time and opportunity to prepare and present its case, taking into consideration the size and complexity of the claims presented. Unless the parties agree otherwise, no evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claim may be held less than six months after the demand for arbitration is filed with the dispute resolution entity.

(e) The arbitrators shall conduct the hearing and shall hear evidence as to the facts, and arguments as to the interpretation and application of contractual provisions. After the hearing, the arbitrators shall issue in writing: (1) Findings of fact, (2) a decision in which the arbitrators interpret the contract and apply it to the facts found and (3) an award. The arbitrators’ findings of fact and decision shall be final and conclusive and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, court or government agency, for errors of fact or law. Awards shall be final and binding and subject to confirmation, modification or vacation pursuant to chapter 909.

*Cited. 169 C. 253; 170 C. 434. Does not operate to waive immunity from suits based on type of contract in question; remedy lies with claims commissioner. 178 C. 352. Contract involved essentially the purchase of laundry equipment and work required to install the equipment was not sufficient for the contract to qualify under statute. 190 C. 212. Contracts for construction of city streets and a city bridge do not come within provisions of statute. 198 C. 185. Cited. 217 C. 281; 239 C. 93. Claim is barred unless it arises directly “under” contract, as opposed to “related to”, “connected with” or “derived from”. 250 C. 553. The waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section requires all existing disputed claims arising under a public works contract to be litigated or arbitrated in a single action. 287 C. 1. Defendant state agency expressly agreed to arbitration proceedings under section and therefore waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability. 294 C. 695. Limited waiver of government immunity from suit does not abrogate doctrine of nullum tempus, i.e. no time runs against the king. 307 C. 412.Cited. 28 CA 175; 29 CA 292. Arbitration proceeding under section is not an action under Sec. 52-592. 87 CA 367. Since the stated basis of the unjust enrichment claim was that plaintiff performed services and provided materials that were not contemplated by the contract itself, the claim does not fall directly under the contract as required by the statute and therefore sovereign immunity bars the claim. 130 CA 211. Department explicitly contested arbitrability of matter and thereby did not waive judicial review of arbitrator’s decision re arbitrability of claim; arbitration panel exceeded its authority by rendering award on a claim that was defined by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity rather than by a contractual agreement. 141 CA 738.Parties may agree to arbitrate as alternative to proceeding by suit. 28 CS 173. Action for breach of contract for highway design made in 1966 cannot be maintained as amendment extending section to design contracts was passed in 1969. 31 CS 313. Cited. 37 CS 50.Subsec. (a):Cited. 211 C. 370; 221 C. 346. Notice under Subsec. does not require explicit statement of intent to bring an action, but only factually adequate written notice by a contractor to a department head asserting a right to payment of money believed to be owed, and plaintiff’s letter constituted sufficient notice of claim. 299 C. 167.Subsec. (e):Because statute governs form of an arbitrator’s findings, decision and award and contains no well-defined, explicit or clear requirement that arbitration award be consistent with findings of fact, plaintiff could not establish the elements necessary to vacate arbitration award on the ground that arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law. 273 C. 746.*

(3) If at any time the Auditors of Public Accounts determine that a complaint is more appropriately investigated by another state agency, the Auditors of Public Accounts shall refer the complaint to such agency. The investigating agency shall provide a status report regarding the referred complaint to the Auditors of Public Accounts upon request.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12-15, the Commissioner of Revenue Services may, upon written request by the Auditors of Public Accounts, disclose return or return information, as defined in section 12-15, to the Auditors of Public Accounts for purposes of preparing a report under subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such return or return information shall not be published in any report prepared in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and shall not otherwise be redisclosed, except that such information may be redisclosed to the Attorney General for purposes of an investigation authorized by subsection (a) of this section.

(5) If a state officer or employee, as defined in section 4-141, a quasi-public agency officer or employee, an officer or employee of a large state contractor or an appointing authority takes or threatens to take any action to impede, fail to renew or cancel a contract between a state agency and a large state contractor, or between a large state contractor and its subcontractor, in retaliation for the disclosure of information pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or subdivision (1) of this subsection to any agency listed in subdivision (1) of this subsection, such affected agency, contractor or subcontractor may, not later than ninety days after learning of such action, threat or failure to renew, bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to recover damages, attorney’s fees and costs.

In the case of a state or quasi-public agency employee, such action shall be subject to appeal to the Employees’ Review Board in accordance with section 5-202, or in the case of state or quasi-public agency employees included in collective bargaining contracts, the procedure provided by such contracts.

(h) Each contract between a state or quasi-public agency and a large state contractor shall provide that, if an officer, employee or appointing authority of a large state contractor takes or threatens to take any personnel action against any employee of the contractor in retaliation for such employee’s disclosure of information to any employee of the contracting state or quasi-public agency or the Auditors of Public Accounts or the Attorney General under the provisions of subsection (a) or subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of this section, the contractor shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each offense, up to a maximum of twenty per cent of the value of the contract. Each violation shall be a separate and distinct offense and in the case of a continuing violation each calendar day’s continuance of the violation shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.

(h), a reference to “subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of this section” for accuracy).

*The term “personnel action” encompasses the term “employment action”, therefore the human rights referee properly applied standards used in adverse employment actions to the employee’s whistle-blower retaliation claims; section does not require extreme measures, such as termination, before its protections are implicated, but, rather, it requires only a personnel action that would dissuade a reasonable employee from whistle-blowing. 135 CA 563. Because section has a remedial purpose, the failure of an employee to comply with section’s prescribed filing period does not divest a human rights referee of subject matter jurisdiction; “any other damages” does not encompass equitable forms of relief, such as an order that requires completion of a professional ethics class, but is confined to compensating victims of whistle-blower retaliation for the economic harm they suffer. 143 CA 839.Plain language reading of section includes “sheriffs” and “deputy sheriffs” among those who could be investigated because of legislature’s use of the words “state department or agency” within the statute; requirement that Attorney General forward information to Chief State’s Attorney if warranted does not make section a criminal statute; power granted to Attorney General under section is not an impermissible intrusion upon powers granted to another department of government. 47 CS 447.*

(2) If the cumulative monthly financial statement issued by the Comptroller pursuant to section 3-115 includes a projected General Fund deficit greater than one per cent of the total of General Fund appropriations, the Governor, within thirty days following the issuance of such statement, shall file a report with such joint standing committees, including a plan which he shall implement to modify such allotments to the extent necessary to prevent a deficit. No modification of an allotment requisition or an allotment in force made by the Governor pursuant to this subsection shall result in a reduction of more than three per cent of the total appropriation from any fund or more than five per cent of any appropriation, except such limitations shall not apply in time of war, invasion or emergency caused by natural disaster.

(c) If a plan submitted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section indicates that a reduction of more than three per cent of the total appropriation from any fund or more than five per cent of any appropriation is required to prevent a deficit, the Governor may request that the Finance Advisory Committee approve any such reduction, provided any modification which would result in a reduction of more than five per cent of total appropriations shall require the approval of the General Assembly.

(d) The secretary shall submit copies of allotment requisitions thus approved or modified or allotments in force thus modified, with the reasons for any modifications, to the administrative heads of the budgeted agencies concerned, to the Comptroller and to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of appropriations and matters relating to the budgets of state agencies, through the Office of Fiscal Analysis. The Comptroller shall set up such allotments on the Comptroller’s books and be governed thereby in the control of expenditures of budgeted agencies.

(e) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize the Governor to reduce allotment requisitions or allotments in force concerning (1) aid to municipalities; or (2) any budgeted agency of the legislative or judicial branch, except that the Governor may propose an aggregate allotment reduction of a specified amount in accordance with this section for the legislative or judicial branch. If the Governor proposes to reduce allotment requisitions or allotments in force for any budgeted agency of the legislative or judicial branch, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall, at least five days before the effective date of such proposed reductions, notify the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives of any such proposal affecting the legislative branch and the Chief Justice of any such proposal affecting the judicial branch. Such notification shall include the amounts, effective dates and reasons necessitating the proposed reductions. Not later than three days after receipt of such notification, the president pro tempore or the speaker, or both, or the Chief Justice, as appropriate, may notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the chairpersons and ranking members of the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, in writing, of any objection to the proposed reductions. The committee may hold a public hearing on such proposed reductions. Such proposed reductions shall become effective unless they are rejected by a two-thirds vote of the members of the committee not later than fifteen days after receipt of the notification of objection to the proposed reductions. If the committee rejects such proposed reductions, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall present an alternative plan to achieve such reductions to the president pro tempore and the speaker for any such proposal affecting the legislative branch or to the Chief Justice for any such proposal affecting the judicial branch. If proposed reductions in allotment requisitions or allotments in force for any budgeted agency of the legislative or judicial branch are not rejected, such reductions shall be achieved as determined by the Joint Committee on Legislative Management or the Chief Justice, as appropriate. The Joint Committee on Legislative Management or the Chief Justice, as appropriate, shall submit such reductions to the Governor through the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management not later than ten days after the proposed reductions become effective.

(e):Subsec. unambiguously confers broad discretion to commissioner to vacate prior decision if the decision being vacated was made pursuant to Subsec. (a), the decision has not been submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to Sec. 4-159(a), and vacating the decision would be “just and equitable”; commissioner has discretion to vacate the three types of decisions to which Subsec. (a) applies whenever he deems it just and equitable for the limited period of time prior to submission of the claim to the General Assembly, but with respect to all other decisions that commissioner has made pursuant to Subsec. (a), he retains discretion to vacate those decisions at any time in the future; plain language of Subsec. does not reference request for review process, and there is no express textual basis for limiting the provision’s application to cases in which a request for review has been filed or to impute a request for review requirement. 305 C. 654.*

(a)(1) Within five days after the convening of the 2002 regular session, the Claims Commissioner shall report to the General Assembly on all claims that have been filed with the Office of the Claims Commissioner pursuant to section 4-147 and have not been disposed of by the Claims Commissioner within three years of the date of filing, except claims in which the parties have stipulated to an extension of time for the Claims Commissioner to dispose of the claim.

The rights and liability of the state in each such action shall be coextensive with and shall equal the rights and liability of private persons in like circumstances.

(d) No such action shall be brought but within one year from the date such authorization to sue is granted.

(i) Costs may be allowed against the state as the court deems just, consistent with the provisions of chapter 901.

(j) The clerk of the court in which judgment is entered against the state shall forward a certified copy of such judgment to the Comptroller. The Attorney General shall certify to the Comptroller when the time allowed by law for proceeding subsequent to final judgment has expired and the Attorney General shall designate the state agency involved in the action. Upon receipt of such judgment and certification the Comptroller shall make payment as follows: Amounts directed by law to be paid from a special fund shall be paid from such special fund; amounts awarded upon contractual claims for goods or services furnished or for property leased shall be paid from the appropriation of the agency which received such goods or services or occupied such property; all other amounts shall be paid from such appropriation as the General Assembly may have made for the payment of claims.

(k) Not later than five days after the convening of each regular session, the Attorney General shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly on the judiciary on the status and disposition of all actions authorized pursuant to this section or section 4-159, or brought against the state under any other provision of law and in which the interests of the state are represented by the Attorney General. The report shall include: (1) The number of such actions pending in state and federal court, categorized by the alleged ground for the action, (2) the number of new actions brought in the preceding year in state and federal court, categorized by the alleged ground for the action, (3) the number of actions disposed of in the preceding year, categorized by the ground for the action that was disposed of and whether the action was disposed of by settlement or litigation to final judgment, and the amount paid for actions within the respective categories, and (4) such other information as may be requested, from time to time, by the joint standing committee of the General Assembly on the judiciary.

#### Section 4-168: Notice prior to action on regulations. Fiscal notes. Hearing or public comment. Posting on eRegulations System. Adoption procedure. Emergency regulations. Technical amendments.

(a) Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h) of this section, an agency, not less than thirty days prior to adopting a proposed regulation, shall (1) post a notice of its intended action on the eRegulations System, which notice shall include (A) a specified public comment period of not less than thirty days, (B) a description sufficiently detailed so as to apprise persons likely to be affected of the issues and subjects involved in the proposed regulation, (C) a statement of the purposes for which the regulation is proposed, (D) a reference to the statutory authority for the proposed regulation, (E) when, where and how interested persons may obtain a copy of the small business impact and regulatory flexibility analysis required pursuant to section 4-168a, and (F) when, where and how interested persons may present their views on the proposed regulation; (2) post a copy of the proposed regulation on the eRegulations System; (3) give notice electronically to each joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of the subject matter of the proposed regulation; (4) give notice electronically or provide a paper copy notice, if requested, to all persons who have made requests to the agency for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings; (5) provide a paper copy or electronic version of the proposed regulation to persons requesting it; and (6) prepare a fiscal note, including an estimate of the cost or of the revenue impact (A) on the state or any municipality of the state, and (B) on small businesses in the state, including an estimate of the number of small businesses subject to the proposed regulation and the projected costs, including but not limited to, reporting, recordkeeping and administrative, associated with compliance with the proposed regulation and, if applicable, the regulatory flexibility analysis prepared under section 4-168a. The governing body of any municipality, if requested, shall provide the agency, within twenty working days, with any information that may be necessary for analysis in preparation of such fiscal note.

(b) Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h) of this section, during the public comment period specified in subsection (a) of this section, all interested persons shall have reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments in writing on the proposed regulation. The agency shall hold a public hearing on the proposed regulation if requested by fifteen persons, by a governmental subdivision or agency or by an association having not less than fifteen members, if notice of the request is received by the agency not later than fourteen days after the date of posting of the notice by the agency on the eRegulations System. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation and revise the fiscal note prepared in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (6) of subsection (a) of this section to indicate any changes made in the proposed regulation. On and after the certification date, each agency shall post the proposed regulation and all documents prepared by the agency pursuant to this subsection and subsection (a) of this section on the eRegulations System. Prior to the certification date, each agency shall create and maintain a regulation-making record for each regulation proposed by such agency, which shall be made available to the public. No regulation shall be found invalid due to the failure of an agency to give notice to each committee of cognizance pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, provided one such committee has been so notified.

(c) If an agency is required by a public act to adopt regulations, the agency, not later than five months after the effective date of the public act or by the time specified in the public act, shall post on the eRegulations System notice of its intent to adopt regulations. If the agency fails to post the notice within such five-month period or by the time specified in the public act, the agency shall submit an electronic statement of its reasons for failure to do so to the Governor, the joint standing committee having cognizance of the subject matter of the regulations and the standing legislative regulation review committee and on and after the certification date, post such statement on the eRegulations System. The agency shall submit the required regulations to the standing legislative regulation review committee, as provided in subsection (b) of section 4-170, not later than one hundred eighty days after posting the notice of its intent to adopt regulations, or electronically submit a statement of its reasons for failure to do so to the committee.

(d) An agency may begin the regulation-making process under this chapter before the effective date of the public act requiring or permitting the agency to adopt regulations, but no regulation may take effect before the effective date of such act.

(e) After the close of the public comment period and prior to submission to the Attorney General, in accordance with section 4-169, the agency shall post on the eRegulations System a notice describing whether the agency has decided to move forward with the proposed regulation. The agency shall provide such notice electronically to all persons who have submitted oral or written comment on the proposed regulation and shall provide a paper copy of such notice to all persons who have submitted comments in a nonelectronic format. The agency shall also post on the eRegulations System: (1) The final wording of the proposed regulation; (2) a statement of the principal reasons in support of its intended action; and (3) a statement of the principal considerations in opposition to its intended action as urged in written or oral comments on the proposed regulation and its reasons for rejecting such considerations.

(f) Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h) of this section, no regulation may be adopted, amended or repealed by any agency until it is (1) approved by the Attorney General as to legal sufficiency, as provided in section 4-169, (2) approved by the standing legislative regulation review committee, as provided in section 4-170, and (3) posted on the eRegulations System by the office of the Secretary of the State, as provided in section 4-172 and section 4-173b.

(g) (1) An agency may proceed to adopt an emergency regulation in accordance with this subsection without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable if (A) the agency finds that adoption of a regulation upon fewer than thirty days’ notice is required (i) due to an imminent peril to the public health, safety or welfare or (ii) by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in order to comply with the provisions of interstate fishery management plans adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission or to meet unforeseen circumstances or emergencies affecting marine resources, (B) the agency states in writing its reasons for that finding, and (C) the Governor approves such finding in writing.

(2) An electronic copy shall be submitted to the standing legislative regulation review committee in the form prescribed in subsection (b) of section 4-170, together with a statement of the terms or substance of the intended action, the purpose of the action and a reference to the statutory authority under which the action is proposed, not later than ten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the proposed effective date of such regulation. The committee may approve or disapprove the emergency regulation, in whole or in part, within such ten-day period at a regular meeting, if one is scheduled, or may upon the call of either chairman or any five or more members hold a special meeting for the purpose of approving or disapproving the regulation, in whole or in part. Failure of the committee to act on such regulation within such ten-day period shall be deemed an approval. If the committee disapproves such regulation, in whole or in part, it shall notify the agency of the reasons for its action. An approved regulation, posted on the eRegulations System by the office of the Secretary of the State, may be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred twenty days renewable once for a period of not exceeding sixty days, provided notification of such sixty-day renewal is posted on the eRegulations System and an electronic copy of such notice is sent to the committee. The sixty-day renewal period may be extended an additional sixty days for emergency regulations described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, provided the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection requests of the standing legislative regulation review committee an extension of the renewal period at the time such regulation is submitted or not less than ten days before the first sixty-day renewal period expires and said committee approves such extension. Failure of the committee to act on such request within ten days shall be deemed an approval of the extension. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude an agency proposing such emergency regulation from adopting a permanent regulation that is identical or substantially similar to the emergency regulation, but such action shall not extend the effective date of the emergency regulation.

(3) If the necessary steps to adopt a permanent regulation, including the posting of notice of intent to adopt, preparation and submission of a fiscal note in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 4-170 and approval by the Attorney General and the standing legislative regulation review committee, are not completed prior to the expiration date of an emergency regulation, the emergency regulation shall cease to be effective on that date.

(h) If an agency finds (1) that technical amendments to an existing regulation are necessary because of (A) the statutory transfer of functions, powers or duties from the agency named in the existing regulation to another agency, (B) a change in the name of the agency, (C) the renumbering of the section of the general statutes containing the statutory authority for the regulation, or (D) a correction in the numbering of the regulation, and no substantive changes are proposed, or (2) that the repeal of a regulation is necessary because the section of the general statutes under which the regulation has been adopted has been repealed and has not been transferred or reenacted, it may elect to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section or may proceed without prior notice or hearing, provided the agency has posted such amendments to or repeal of a regulation on the eRegulations System. Any such amendments to or repeal of a regulation shall be submitted in the form and manner prescribed in subsection (b) of section 4-170, to the Attorney General, as provided in section 4-169, and to the standing legislative regulation review committee, as provided in section 4-170, for approval and upon approval shall be submitted to the office of the Secretary of the State for posting on the eRegulations System with, in the case of renumbering of sections only, a correlated table of the former and new section numbers.

(i) No regulation adopted after October 1, 1985, is valid unless adopted in substantial compliance with this section. A proceeding to contest any regulation on the ground of noncompliance with the procedural requirements of this section shall be commenced within two years from the effective date of the regulation.

Said department and committee shall advise and assist agencies in complying with the provisions of this section.

(d) The requirements contained in this section shall not apply to emergency regulations issued pursuant to subsection (f) of section 4-168; regulations that do not affect small businesses directly, including, but not limited to, regulations concerning the administration of federal programs; regulations concerning costs and standards for service businesses such as nursing homes, long-term care facilities, medical care providers, day care facilities, water companies, nonprofit 501(c)(3) agencies, group homes and residential care facilities; and regulations adopted to implement the provisions of sections 4a-60g to 4a-60i, inclusive.

If an agency determines that any part of the regulation-making record is impractical to display or is inappropriate for public display on the eRegulations System, the agency shall describe the part omitted in a statement posted on the eRegulations System and shall maintain a copy of the omitted material readily available for public inspection at the principal office of the agency.

(c) The regulation-making record need not constitute the exclusive basis for agency action on that regulation or for judicial review thereof.

#### Section 4-170: Legislative regulation review committee. Submission requirements for regulations. Disapproved regulations. Resubmitted regulations.

(a) There shall be a standing legislative committee to review all regulations of the several state departments and agencies following the proposal thereof, which shall consist of eight members of the House of Representatives, four from each major party, to be appointed on the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January in the odd-numbered years, by the speaker of said House, and six members of the Senate, three from each major party, to be appointed on or before said dates by the president pro tempore of the Senate. The members shall serve for the balance of the term for which they were elected. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the authority making the appointment. There shall be two cochairpersons, one of whom shall be a member of the Senate and one of whom shall be a member of the House of Representatives, each appointed by the applicable appointing authority, provided the cochairpersons shall not be members of the same political party and shall be from alternate parties in the respective houses in each successive term. For purposes of this section, “appointing authority” means the speaker or minority leader of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore or minority leader of the Senate, as appropriate according to the respective house and party of the member to be appointed. Each chairperson may call meetings of the committee for the performance of its duties.

(b) (1) No adoption, amendment or repeal of any regulation, except a regulation issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 4-168, shall be effective until (A) an electronic copy of the proposed regulation approved by the Attorney General, as provided in section 4-169, and an electronic copy of the regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in section 4-168a are submitted to the standing legislative regulation review committee in a manner designated by the committee, by the agency proposing the regulation, (B) the regulation is approved by the committee, at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose, and (C) a certified electronic copy of the regulation is submitted to the office of the Secretary of the State by the agency, as provided in section 4-172, and the regulation is posted on the eRegulations System by the Secretary. (2) The date of submission for purposes of subsection (c) of this section shall be the first Tuesday of each month. Any regulation received by the committee on or before the first Tuesday of a month shall be deemed to have been submitted on the first Tuesday of that month. Any regulation submitted after the first Tuesday of a month shall be deemed to be submitted on the first Tuesday of the next succeeding month. (3) The form of proposed regulations which are submitted to the committee shall be as follows: New language added to an existing regulation shall be underlined; language to be deleted shall be enclosed in brackets and a new regulation or new section of a regulation shall be preceded by the word “(NEW)” in capital letters. Each proposed regulation shall have a statement of its purpose following the final section of the regulation. (4) The committee may permit any proposed regulation, including, but not limited to, a proposed regulation which by reference incorporates in whole or in part, any other code, rule, regulation, standard or specification, to be submitted in summary form together with a statement of purpose for the proposed regulation. On and after October 1, 1994, if the committee finds that a federal statute requires, as a condition of the state exercising regulatory authority, that a Connecticut regulation at all times must be identical to a federal statute or regulation, then the committee may approve a Connecticut regulation that by reference specifically incorporates future amendments to such federal statute or regulation provided the agency that proposed the Connecticut regulation shall submit for approval amendments to such Connecticut regulations to the committee not later than thirty days after the effective date of such amendment, and provided further the committee may hold a public hearing on such Connecticut amendments. (5) The agency shall also provide the committee with a copy of the fiscal note prepared pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4-168. At the time of submission to the committee, the agency shall submit an electronic copy of the proposed regulation and the fiscal note to (A) the Office of Fiscal Analysis which, not later than seven days after receipt, shall submit an analysis of the fiscal note to the committee; and (B) each joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of the subject matter of the proposed regulation. No regulation shall be found invalid due to the failure of an agency to submit an electronic copy of the proposed regulation and the fiscal note to each committee of cognizance, provided such regulation and fiscal note have been electronically submitted to one such committee.

(c) The committee shall review all proposed regulations and, in its discretion, may hold public hearings on any proposed regulation and may approve, disapprove or reject without prejudice, in whole or in part, any such regulation. If the committee fails to so approve, disapprove or reject without prejudice a proposed regulation, within sixty-five days after the date of submission as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the committee shall be deemed to have approved the proposed regulation for purposes of this section.

(d) If the committee disapproves a proposed regulation in whole or in part, it shall give notice of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval to the agency, and no agency shall thereafter issue any regulation or directive or take other action to implement such disapproved regulation, or part thereof, as the case may be, except that the agency may adopt a substantively new regulation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided the General Assembly may reverse such disapproval under the provisions of section 4-171. If the committee disapproves any regulation proposed for the purpose of implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program, the General Assembly shall be required to either sustain or reverse the disapproval.

(e) If the committee rejects a proposed regulation without prejudice, in whole or in part, it shall notify the agency of the reasons for the rejection and the agency, following approval by the Attorney General for legal sufficiency pursuant to section 4-169, shall resubmit the regulation in revised form to the committee, if the adoption of such regulation is required by the general statutes or any public or special act, not later than the first Tuesday of the second month following such rejection without prejudice and may so resubmit any other regulation, in the same manner as provided in this section for the initial submission. Each resubmission under this subsection shall include a summary of revisions identified by paragraph. The committee shall review and take action on such resubmitted regulation no later than thirty-five days after the date of submission, as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Posting of the notice on the eRegulations System pursuant to the provisions of section 4-168 shall not be required in the case of such resubmission.

(f) If an agency fails to submit any regulation approved in whole or in part by the standing legislative regulation review committee to the office of the Secretary of the State as provided in section 4-172, not later than fourteen days after the date of approval, the agency shall notify the committee, not later than five days after such fourteen-day period, of its reasons for failing to submit such regulation. If any agency fails to comply with the time limits established under subsection (b) of section 4-168, or under subsection (e) of this section, the administrative head of such agency shall submit to the committee a written explanation of the reasons for such noncompliance. The committee, upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of its members, may grant an extension of the time limits established under subsection (b) of section 4-168 and under subsection (e) of this section. If no such extension is granted, the administrative head of the agency shall personally appear before the standing legislative regulation review committee, at a time prescribed by the committee, to explain such failure to comply. After any such appearance, the committee may, upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of its members, report such noncompliance to the Governor. Within fourteen days thereafter the Governor shall report to the committee concerning the action the Governor has taken to ensure compliance with the provisions of section 4-168 and with the provisions of this section.

Within twenty-five days of the filing of the petition, the agency shall decide whether to reconsider the final decision. The failure of the agency to make that determination within twenty-five days of such filing shall constitute a denial of the petition.

(2) Within forty days of the personal delivery or mailing of the final decision, the agency, regardless of whether a petition for reconsideration has been filed, may decide to reconsider the final decision.

(3) If the agency decides to reconsider a final decision, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the agency shall proceed in a reasonable time to conduct such additional proceedings as may be necessary to render a decision modifying, affirming or reversing the final decision, provided such decision made after reconsideration shall be rendered not later than ninety days following the date on which the agency decides to reconsider the final decision.

(b) On a showing of changed conditions, the agency may reverse or modify the final decision, at any time, at the request of any person or on the agency’s own motion. The procedure set forth in this chapter for contested cases shall be applicable to any proceeding in which such reversal or modification of any final decision is to be considered. The party or parties who were the subject of the original final decision, or their successors, if known, and intervenors in the original contested case, shall be notified of the proceeding and shall be given the opportunity to participate in the proceeding. Any decision to reverse or modify a final decision shall make provision for the rights or privileges of any person who has been shown to have relied on such final decision.

Since phrase “institution of agency proceedings” means the institution of a particular action at law or case in litigation and “proceeding” encompasses a broader category of events than that encompassed by a hearing or final decision, Department of Public Utility Control instituted proceedings against plaintiff when it issued the letter to plaintiff informing it of its initiation of the new investigation; grounds for revocation of license must be more than self-evident to the licensee, thus Department of Public Utility Control’s letter to licensee which merely advised that department had initiated an investigation into whether it should revoke licensee’s certificate of public convenience and necessity, stated certain departmental procedural practices and indicated that licensee was designated as a party to the proceeding without reference to the basis underlying initiation of the proceeding did not satisfy statutory requirements because the letter commenced revocation proceedings and could not have provided licensee with notice and opportunity to show compliance prior to institution of the proceeding; “opportunity to show compliance” provision represents a “second chance” doctrine which allows licensee opportunity to put its house in lawful order before more formal agency proceedings are undertaken; court did not interpret Subsec. as requiring a hearing or opportunity for a hearing prior to revocation of license or as component of the “opportunity to show compliance” provision. 270 C. 778.Cited. 14 CA 552; 24 CA 662; judgment reversed, see 223 C. 618; 34 CA 343; 37 CA 777. Where plaintiff had been given ample notice of charges against him and had a sufficient opportunity to be heard, failure of state electrical work examining board to hold a compliance hearing prior to license revocation did not deprive plaintiff of his statutory or constitutional rights. 104 CA 655.*

#### Section 4-183: Appeal to Superior Court.

(a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court as provided in this section. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to the filing of such an appeal.

(b) A person may appeal a preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling to the Superior Court if (1) it appears likely that the person will otherwise qualify under this chapter to appeal from the final agency action or ruling and (2) postponement of the appeal would result in an inadequate remedy.

(c) (1) Within forty-five days after mailing of the final decision under section 4-180 or, if there is no mailing, within forty-five days after personal delivery of the final decision under said section, or (2) within forty-five days after the agency denies a petition for reconsideration of the final decision pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a, or (3) within forty-five days after mailing of the final decision made after reconsideration pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a or, if there is no mailing, within forty-five days after personal delivery of the final decision made after reconsideration pursuant to said subdivisions, or (4) within forty-five days after the expiration of the ninety-day period required under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a if the agency decides to reconsider the final decision and fails to render a decision made after reconsideration within such period, whichever is applicable and is later, a person appealing as provided in this section shall serve a copy of the appeal on the agency that rendered the final decision at its office or at the office of the Attorney General in Hartford and file the appeal with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the person appealing resides or, if that person is not a resident of this state, with the clerk of the court for the judicial district of New Britain. Within that time, the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, provided failure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Service of the appeal shall be made by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a state marshal or other officer, or by personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions. If service of the appeal is made by mail, service shall be effective upon deposit of the appeal in the mail.

(d) The person appealing, not later than fifteen days after filing the appeal, shall file or cause to be filed with the clerk of the court an affidavit, or the state marshal’s return, stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision, and, if service was not made on a party, the reason for failure to make service. If the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.

(e) If service has not been made on a party, the court, on motion, shall make such orders of notice of the appeal as are reasonably calculated to notify each party not yet served.

(f) The filing of an appeal shall not, of itself, stay enforcement of an agency decision. An application for a stay may be made to the agency, to the court or to both. Filing of an application with the agency shall not preclude action by the court. A stay, if granted, shall be on appropriate terms.

(g) Within thirty days after the service of the appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the agency shall transcribe any portion of the record that has not been transcribed and transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from, which shall include the agency’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. By stipulation of all parties to such appeal proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.

(h) If, before the date set for hearing on the merits of an appeal, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.

(i) The appeal shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. If alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency are not shown in the record or if facts necessary to establish aggrievement are not shown in the record, proof limited thereto may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.

(j) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. If the court finds such prejudice, it shall sustain the appeal and, if appropriate, may render a judgment under subsection (k) of this section or remand the case for further proceedings. For purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment.

(k) If a particular agency action is required by law, the court, on sustaining the appeal, may render a judgment that modifies the agency decision, orders the particular agency action, or orders the agency to take such action as may be necessary to effect the particular action.

(l) In all appeals taken under this section, costs may be taxed in favor of the prevailing party in the same manner, and to the same extent, that costs are allowed in judgments rendered by the Superior Court. No costs shall be taxed against the state, except as provided in section 4-184a.

(m) In any case in which a person appealing claims that he cannot pay the costs of an appeal under this section, he shall, within the time permitted for filing the appeal, file with the clerk of the court to which the appeal is to be taken an application for waiver of payment of such fees, costs and necessary expenses, including the requirements of bond, if any. The application shall conform to the requirements prescribed by rule of the judges of the Superior Court. After such hearing as the court determines is necessary, the court shall render its judgment on the application, which judgment shall contain a statement of the facts the court has found, with its conclusions thereon. The filing of the application for the waiver shall toll the time limits for the filing of an appeal until such time as a judgment on such application is rendered.

Service of process by a person who lacked statutory authority did not deprive trial court of subject matter jurisdiction for an administrative appeal when in every other respect service met requirements of statute; court found service requirement of statute to be directory and not mandatory and, in the absence of a showing of prejudice, found service by a person who lacked statutory authority not to be the equivalent of a total failure of service of process. 69 CA 563. Failure of party to file administrative appeal under the UAPA within the 45 days required deprives trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal; thus, upon landlord’s failure to file a timely appeal from Banking Commissioner’s order requiring defendant landlord to return a security deposit, commissioner’s findings and conclusions became final, binding and not subject to review. 76 CA 824.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a state agency shall conduct any additional audits which it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities, upon a written determination by the executive authority of the agency, based on evidence of fiscal irregularities or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, and after consulting with the cognizant agency.

(a) A person may bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford against any person who violates subsection (a) of section 4-275, for the person who brings the action and for the state.

#### Section 4-278: Prosecution by Attorney General. Withdrawal. Settlement. Limits on individual’s participation. Division of proceeds. Attorneys’ fees and costs.

(a) If the Attorney General, pursuant to section 4-277, elects to proceed with the action, the Attorney General shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and shall not be bound by any act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in this section.

(b) The Attorney General may withdraw such action notwithstanding the objections of the person bringing the action if the Attorney General has notified such person of the filing of the motion and the court has provided such person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.

(c) The Attorney General may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person bringing the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.

(d) Upon a showing by (1) the Attorney General that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person bringing the action would (A) interfere with or unduly delay the Attorney General’s prosecution of the case, or (B) be repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment; or (2) the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person bringing the action would be for purposes of harassment, or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person’s participation, including, but not limited to, (i) limiting the number of witnesses that such person may call, (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of any such witnesses, (iii) limiting the person’s cross-examination of any such witnesses, or (iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.

(e) If the court awards civil penalties or damages to the state or if the Attorney General settles with the defendant and receives civil penalties or damages, the person bringing such action shall receive from the proceeds not less than fifteen per cent but not more than twenty-five per cent of such proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, based upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All such expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information that was not provided by the person bringing the action relating to allegations or transactions (1) in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, (2) in a report, hearing, audit or investigation conducted by the General Assembly, a committee of the General Assembly, the Auditors of Public Accounts, a state agency or a quasi-public agency, or (3) from the news media, the court may award from such proceeds to the person bringing the action such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than ten per cent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All such expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.

#### Section 4-279: Civil action when Attorney General declines to proceed. Division of proceeds. Attorneys’ fees and costs. Stay of discovery.

(a) If the Attorney General declines to proceed with the action, the person who brought the action shall have the right to conduct the action. In the event that the Attorney General declines to proceed with the action, upon the request of the Attorney General, the court shall order that copies of all pleadings filed in the action and copies of any deposition transcripts be provided to the state. When the person who brought the action proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of such person, may permit the Attorney General to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.

(b) A person bringing an action under this section or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than twenty-five per cent or more than thirty per cent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All such expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.

(c) If a defendant prevails in the action conducted under this section and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment, the court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses to the defendant.

(d) Irrespective of whether the Attorney General proceeds with the action, upon request and showing by the Attorney General that certain motions or requests for discovery by a person bringing the action would interfere with the state’s investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than sixty days from the date of the order of the stay. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the stay for an additional sixty-day period upon a further showing in camera that the state has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. For the purposes of this subsection, the Chief State’s Attorney or state’s attorney for the appropriate judicial district may appear to explain to the court the potential impact of such discovery on a pending criminal investigation or prosecution.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-277, the Attorney General may elect to pursue the state’s claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person bringing the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under the provisions of sections 4-277 to 4-279, inclusive. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under sections 4-277 to 4-279, inclusive. A finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the state, if the time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.

#### Section 4-281: Civil action by individual who committed prohibited act. Reduction of proceeds.

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 4-278 and 4-279, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of subsection (a) of section 4-275, upon which violation an action was brought, then the court may reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise receive under section 4-278 or 4-279, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If a person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of subsection (a) of section 4-275, such person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the Attorney General to continue the action.

(b) Unless opposed by the state, the court shall dismiss an action or claim brought under section 4-277 if allegations or transactions that are substantially the same as those alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed (1) in a state criminal, civil or administrative hearing in which the state or its agent is a party, (2) in a report, hearing, audit or investigation conducted by the General Assembly, a committee of the General Assembly, the Auditors of Public Accounts, a state agency or quasi-public agency, or (3) by the news media, except the court shall not dismiss such action or claim if the action or claim is brought by the Attorney General or the person who is an original source of information.

(c) For purposes of this section, “original source” means an individual who (1) voluntarily discloses to the state information on which the allegations or transactions in an action or claim are based, prior to public disclosure of such information as described in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, or (2) has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and has voluntarily provided the information to the state before filing an action or claim under sections 4-276 to 4-280, inclusive.

(b) Relief under subsection (a) of this section shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.
