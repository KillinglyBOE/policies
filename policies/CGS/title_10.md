#### Section 10-46: Regional board of education.

(a) The affairs of the regional school district shall be administered by a regional board of education, which shall consist of not fewer than five members. Each member town shall elect at least one member. The committee report shall determine the number of members of such regional board and the representation of each town. The first members of such regional board of education shall be nominated and elected at a meeting of the legislative body of each town held within thirty days after the referendum creating the district. The regional board of education at its first meeting, called by the Commissioner of Education within ten days from the time the last member town to appoint members to the regional board has done so, shall organize and the members shall serve until their successors are elected and qualify. At such meeting, the board shall determine the term of office of each member according to the following principles: (1) The term of office of each successor shall be four years; (2) to establish a continuity of membership, a system of rotation shall be used; if the board has an even number of members, one-half of such number shall be elected every two years and if the board has an uneven number of members, no more than a bare majority or a bare minority shall be elected every two years, except when the unexpired portion of the term of a vacated office must be filled; (3) the same system of rotation shall be used for election of the representatives of each member town, if possible; (4) if necessary, it shall be determined by lot which of the initial members shall serve the short terms; (5) at the first election of members in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section, no more than half the offices held by initial board members shall be filled; (6) the offices held by the remaining initial board members shall be filled at the second election held in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section. Thereafter, members of the board shall be nominated and elected in their respective towns in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section as determined by the legislative body of each town.

(b) (1) At least thirty days before the expiration of the term of office of any board member, a town meeting shall be held in accordance with chapter 90 to nominate and elect a successor. Any person who is an elector of such town may vote at such meeting. If a vacancy occurs in the office of any member of the regional board of education, the town affected, at a town meeting called within thirty days from the beginning of such vacancy, shall nominate and elect a successor to serve for the unexpired portion of the term in accordance with the above procedure. (2) Where members of the regional school board are to be elected at-large under a plan for reapportionment recommended under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-63l, and approved under sections 10-63m and 10-63n, at least thirty days before the expiration of the term of office of any board member, a meeting of the voters of the entire regional school district shall be held to nominate and elect successors in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. Any person who is an elector of any member town may vote at such regional meeting. Vacancies shall be filled by a regional meeting called within thirty days from the beginning of such vacancy.

(c) Board members shall be nominated and elected in the same manner as town officers in accordance with the provisions of title 9 except that (1) section 9-167a and parts II and III of chapter 146 shall not apply, (2) the board members so elected shall take office in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and if members of the regional school board are elected at-large under a plan for reapportionment recommended under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-63l, and approved under sections 10-63m and 10-63n, a caucus of the voters of the entire regional school district shall be held to nominate candidates for election to the board in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. At such caucus, any person who is an elector of any member town may vote. If a vacancy occurs in the office of any member of the regional board of education, the legislative body of the town affected shall elect a successor to serve until the next general election, at which time a successor shall be elected to serve any unexpired portion of such term, except that if members are elected at-large, such successor shall be nominated and elected at a meeting of the entire regional school district held as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

(d) All members of a regional board of education, except those members regularly elected in the month of May, shall take office on the first day of the month following their election. Those members of a regional board of education regularly elected in the month of May shall take office on the first day of July. Such board shall hold an organizational meeting in the month following the last election of members thereof held in the member towns in any calendar year at which time the board shall elect by ballot from its membership a chairperson, a secretary, a treasurer and any other officer deemed necessary and may annually thereafter elect such officers. In the case of a tie vote in the balloting for any officer, such tie shall be broke by lot. The treasurer shall give bond to the regional board of education in an amount determined by the members thereof. The cost of such bond shall be borne by the district.

(e) Each regional school district meeting and caucus held pursuant to subsection (b) and (c) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with standard parliamentary practice. A moderator shall be chosen to preside over such meeting or caucus. A majority of those present and eligible to vote at such meeting or caucus shall determine the manner in which any vote shall be taken. The moderator shall certify all results of such meeting or caucus to the secretary of the state who shall then officially notify each town within the regional school district of the result.

Section 10-47a is repealed.

**(1963, P.A. 444, S. 2; 1969, P.A. 698, S. 27.)**

#### Section 10-47b: Addition or withdrawal of grades.

(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any regional school district which does not include all elementary and secondary grades may add or withdraw grades in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) or, if applicable, subdivision (2) of this subsection.

(1) Any regional board of education in a school district which does not include all elementary and secondary school grades may recommend a study of the advisability of the addition to or withdrawal of grades from the regional school district or, upon the request of two or more of the town boards of education of the member towns, shall recommend such a study to the chairmen of the town boards of education and chairmen of the boards of finance or other such fiscal authorities in each town affected. Within thirty days of receipt of such recommendation, such chairmen shall each appoint one of the members of their boards and the chairman of the regional board of education shall appoint one member of the regional board from each member town to a study committee. The Commissioner of Education shall appoint a consultant to the study committee. The study committee shall proceed in the same manner as the temporary regional school study committee except that the expenses of the committee shall be borne by the regional school district and shall not exceed three dollars times the number of pupils in average daily membership of such town and regional school districts as defined in section 10-261 and the committee shall submit its report to the participating towns no later than one year from the date of its organizational meeting. If the committee recommends a plan for addition to or withdrawal of grades from the regional school district and the referenda held in the manner provided in section 10-45 result in an affirmative vote in the regional school district as a whole, the participating towns shall implement the plan.

(2) Any regional board of education in a school district which does not include all elementary and secondary school grades and has a total of three member towns, each with a population between three thousand and seven thousand five hundred persons pursuant to subdivision (27) of section 10-262f and a combined population for such towns of at least ten thousand persons, but fewer than twenty thousand persons may recommend and develop a plan for the addition to or withdrawal of grades from the regional school district or, upon the request of two or more of the town boards of education of the member towns, may make such recommendation and develop such a plan. If the regional board of education recommends a plan for addition to or withdrawal of grades from the regional school district, referenda shall be held in the manner provided in section 10-45. If such referenda results in an affirmative vote in the regional school district as a whole, the participating towns shall implement the plan.

(b) The procedures in subsection (a) of this section shall not be used to dissolve a regional school district, but may be used to empower the regional school district to administer all programs which are provided in the member towns and are under the general supervision and control of the State Board of Education. In such case, if the vote in each member town affirms the expansion, the town boards of education in such member towns shall be dissolved in accordance with section 10-46a. If the vote is not affirmative in all the member towns, but is affirmative in a majority of such towns, the towns voting in favor of such expansion may initiate a study of the feasibility of establishing a regional school district to administer all programs which are provided in such towns and are under the general supervision and control of the State Board of Education. Such study shall be initiated and conducted pursuant to sections 10-39 through 10-45. In such case, the study may be made forthwith without using the procedures for withdrawal of a town or dissolution of a regional school district provided in sections 10-63a through 10-63c. If a second regional school district is so established by referenda, the first regional school district shall be dissolved. The State Board of Education shall make the relevant determinations required by section 10-63c for such dissolution of an existing regional school district. The assets apportioned to the member towns of the new regional school district may be transferred directly to said district. If secondary schools are among the assets so transferred to the new regional district, said district shall accept applications from the remaining school districts for admission of secondary students for a tuition based on per pupil cost for a period of at least three years after the dissolution. The State Board of Education may withhold from the next grant paid pursuant to section 10-262i to the town or regional school districts so established an amount equal to the proportionate share to be borne by each such district of the cost of the services rendered by said state board during the dissolution of the regional school district.

With the exception of the terms which pertain to the capital contribution of member towns, the transfer of property to the regional school district, the grades included, the size of the board of education and the representation of each town on the board and the towns to be served by the regional school district, the terms of the plan approved through referenda pursuant to section 10-45 may be amended as follows: If a regional board of education finds it advisable to amend the plan or if the legislative body of a town served by the regional board of education requests amendment of such plan, the regional board of education shall prepare a report on the proposed amendment, including the question to be presented, file a copy with the Commissioner of Education and the clerk of each member town and make copies of such report available to the public at a district meeting called to present the plan. After such public hearing, the board shall set the date for referenda which shall be held simultaneously in each member town between the hours of six a.m. and eight p.m. At least thirty days before the date of the referenda, the regional board of education shall notify the town clerk in each member town to call the referendum on the specified date to vote on the specified question. The warning of such referenda shall be published, the vote taken and the results thereof canvassed and declared in the same manner as is provided for the election of officers of a town. The town clerk of each town shall certify the vote of the town to the regional board of education and the Commissioner of Education.

#### Section 10-51: Fiscal year. Budget. Payments by member towns; adjustments to payments. Investment of funds. Temporary borrowing. Reserve funds.

(a) The fiscal year of a regional school district shall be July first to June thirtieth. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less than two weeks before the annual meeting held pursuant to section 10-47, the board shall hold a public district meeting to present a proposed budget for the next fiscal year. Any person may recommend the inclusion or deletion of expenditures at such time. After the public hearing, the board shall prepare an annual budget for the next fiscal year, make available on request copies thereof and deliver a reasonable number to the town clerk of each of the towns in the district at least five days before the annual meeting. At the annual meeting on the first Monday in May, the board shall present a budget which includes a statement of (1) estimated receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal year, (2) estimated receipts and expenditures for the current fiscal year, (3) estimated surplus or deficit in operating funds at the end of the current fiscal year, (4) bonded or other debt, (5) estimated per pupil expenditure for the current and for the next fiscal year, and (6) such other information as is necessary in the opinion of the board. Persons present and eligible to vote under section 7-6 may accept or reject the proposed budget except as provided below. No person who is eligible to vote in more than one town in the regional school district is eligible to cast more than one vote on any issue considered at a regional school district meeting or referendum held pursuant to this section. Any person who violates this section by fraudulently casting more than one vote or ballot per issue shall be fined not more than three thousand five hundred dollars and shall be imprisoned not more than two years and shall be disenfranchised. The regional board of education may, in the call to the meeting, designate that the vote on the motion to adopt the budget shall be by paper ballots at the district meeting held on the budget or by a “yes” or “no” vote on the voting tabulators in each of the member towns on the day following the district meeting. If submitted to a vote by voting tabulator, questions may be included on the ballot for persons voting “no” to indicate whether the budget is too high or too low, provided the vote on such questions shall be for advisory purposes only and not binding upon the board. Two hundred or more persons qualified to vote in any regional district meeting called to adopt a budget may petition the regional board, in writing, at least three days prior to such meeting, requesting that any item or items on the call of such meeting be submitted to the persons qualified to vote in the meeting for a vote by paper ballot or on the voting tabulators in each of the member towns on the day following the district meeting and in accordance with the appropriate procedures provided in section 7-7. If a majority of such persons voting reject the budget, the board shall, within four weeks thereafter and upon notice of not less than one week, call a district meeting to consider the same or an amended budget. Such meetings shall be convened at such intervals until a budget is approved. If the budget is not approved before the beginning of a fiscal year, the disbursing officer for each member town, or the designee of such officer, shall make necessary expenditures to such district in amounts equal to the total of the town’s appropriation to the district for the previous year and the town’s proportionate share in any increment in debt service over the previous fiscal year, pursuant to section 7-405 until the budget is approved. The town shall receive credit for such expenditures once the budget is approved for the fiscal year. After the budget is approved, the board shall estimate the share of the net expenses to be paid by each member town in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and notify the treasurer thereof. With respect to adoption of a budget for the period from the organization of the board to the beginning of the first full fiscal year, the board may use the above procedure at any time within such period. If the board needs to submit a supplementary budget, the general procedure specified in this section shall be used.

(b) For the purposes of this section, “net expenses” means estimated expenditures, including estimated capital expenditures, less estimated receipts as presented in a regional school district budget. On the date or dates fixed by the board, each town in the district shall pay a share of the cost of capital outlay, including costs for school building projects under chapter 173, and current expenditures necessary for the operation of the district. The board shall determine the amount to be paid by each member town. Such amount shall bear the same ratio to the net expenses of the district as the number of pupils resident in such town in average daily membership in the regional school district during the preceding school year bears to the total number of such pupils in all the member towns, provided that the board may recalculate such amount based on the number of pupils in average daily membership in the regional school district for the current school year and may adjust each member town’s payment to the regional school district for the following fiscal year by the difference between the last such payment and the recalculated amount. Until the regional school district has been in operation for one year, such amounts shall be based on the average daily membership of pupils in like grades from each of such towns at any school at which children were in attendance at the expense of such towns during the preceding school year.

(c) The board shall deposit or invest temporarily any funds which are not needed immediately for the operation of the school district as permitted in section 7-400 or 7-402. Any income derived from such deposits or investments shall be used at least semiannually to reduce the net expenses. The board shall use any budget appropriation which has not been expended by the end of the fiscal year to reduce the net expenses of the district for the following fiscal year. The board may borrow funds temporarily and issue notes or other obligations, and pay interest thereon, in anticipation of payments to be made to it by a member town or the state, for the operation of its schools. Such notes or obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the board, and shall be general obligations of the regional school district and its member towns. The date, maturity, interest rate, form, manner of sale and other terms of such notes or other obligations shall be determined by the board or any officer or body to whom the board delegates authority to make such determinations. Such notes may be renewed from time to time, provided all such notes shall mature and be payable no later than the end of the fiscal year during which such member town or state payments are payable.

(d) (1) Prior to June 7, 2006, upon the recommendation and the approval of a majority of members on the board, a regional board of education may create a reserve fund to finance a specific capital improvement or the acquisition of any specific piece of equipment. Such fund shall thereafter be termed “reserve fund for specific capital improvements or equipment purchases”. No annual appropriation to such fund shall exceed one per cent of the annual district budget. Appropriations to such fund shall be included in the share of net expenses to be paid by each member town until the fund established pursuant to this subdivision is discontinued. The board shall annually submit a complete and detailed report of the condition of such fund to the member towns. Such fund may be discontinued, after recommendation by the board and approval by the board, and any amounts held in the fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the district.

(2) On and after June 7, 2006, a regional board of education, by a majority vote of its members, may create a reserve fund for capital and nonrecurring expenditures. Such fund shall thereafter be termed “reserve fund for capital and nonrecurring expenditures”. The aggregate amount of annual and supplemental appropriations by a district to such fund shall not exceed one per cent of the annual district budget for such fiscal year. Annual appropriations to such fund shall be included in the share of net expenses to be paid by each member town. Supplemental appropriations to such fund may be made from estimated fiscal year end surplus in operating funds. Interest and investment earnings received with respect to amounts held in the fund shall be credited to such fund. The board shall annually submit a complete and detailed report of the condition of such fund to the member towns. Upon the recommendation and approval by the regional board of education, any part or the whole of such fund may be used for capital and nonrecurring expenditures, but such use shall be restricted to the funding of all or part of the planning, construction, reconstruction or acquisition of any specific capital improvement or the acquisition of any specific item of equipment. Upon the approval of any such expenditure an appropriation shall be set up, plainly designated for the project or acquisition for which it has been authorized, and such unexpended appropriation may be continued until such project or acquisition is completed. Any unexpended portion of such appropriation remaining after such completion shall revert to said fund.

#### Section 10-51a: Petition to determine deficiency in town payment.

If any town which is a member of a regional school district fails to include in its annual town budget appropriations for any year the amount necessary for payment of its proportionate share of the annual budget of such regional school district, as required by section 10-51 or section 5 of number 405 of the special acts of 1959, ten or more taxable inhabitants of a town within such school district, a majority of the board of selectmen of any such town, the Attorney General, a holder or owner of bonds or notes of such regional school district, the board of education of such regional school district or the State Board of Education may petition the Superior Court to determine the amount of the alleged deficiency. If the court finds such deficiency to exist, it shall order such town, through its treasurer, selectmen and assessor, to provide a sum of money equal to such deficiency, together with a sum of money equal to twenty-five per cent thereof. The amount of the deficiency shall be paid by the town to the regional school district as soon as it is available; the additional sum of twenty-five per cent shall be kept in a separate account by such town and shall be applied toward payment of such town’s share of the annual budget of the regional school district in the following year. If such order is made prior to the fixing of the annual tax rate of such town, such tax rate shall be adjusted to cover the sums included in such order. If such order is made after the fixing of the annual tax rate of such town, the sums included in such order shall be provided by the town from any available cash surplus, from any contingent fund, from borrowing, through a rate bill under the provisions of section 12-123 or from any combination thereof. Any borrowing to meet such deficiency shall be made by the town treasurer, with the approval of a majority of the selectmen, and no vote of the town shall be required therefor. Such borrowed amount shall be included in the estimated expenses of the town in the tax levy for the next fiscal year. Petitions brought to the Superior Court under the provisions of this section shall be privileged in respect to their assignment for hearing.

#### Section 10-51b: Reserve fund for employee sick leave and severance benefits.

A regional board of education, by a majority vote of its members, may create a reserve fund for accrued liabilities for employee sick leave and severance benefits. Such fund shall thereafter be termed “reserve fund for employee sick leave and severance benefits”. The aggregate amount of annual and supplemental appropriations by a district to such fund in any one fiscal year shall not exceed the actuarially recommended contribution from the annual district budget for such fiscal year. No payments shall be made to the fund which will cause the amount of such fund to exceed the accrued liability for such employee benefits as determined by the district’s annual financial statements, except for the addition of interest and investment earnings with respect to amounts held in the fund. Annual appropriations to such fund shall be included in the share of net expenses to be paid by each member town. Supplemental appropriations to such fund may be made from estimated fiscal year end surplus in operating funds. Interest and investment earnings received with respect to amounts held in the fund shall be credited to such fund. The board shall annually submit a complete and detailed report of the condition of such fund to the member towns. Upon the approval of the board, by a majority vote of its members, any part or the whole of such fund may be used for the payment of employee sick leave and severance benefits without further appropriation. Such fund may be discontinued, after recommendation by the board and approval by the board, and any amounts held in the fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the district.

#### Section 10-56: Corporate powers. Bond issues.

(a) A regional school district shall be a body politic and corporate with power to sue and be sued; to purchase, receive, hold and convey real and personal property for school purposes; and to build, equip, purchase, rent, maintain or expand schools. Such district may issue bonds, notes or other obligations in the name and upon the full faith and credit of such district and the member towns to acquire land, prepare sites, purchase or erect buildings and equip the same for school purposes, if so authorized by referendum. Such referendum shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure provided in section 10-47c except that any person entitled to vote under section 7-6 may vote and the question shall be determined by the majority of those persons voting in the regional school district as a whole. The exercise of any or all of the powers set forth in this section shall not be construed to be an amendment of a regional plan pursuant to said section 10-47c. A regional board of education may expend any premium in connection with such issue, interest on the proceeds of such issue or unused portion of such issue to add to the land or buildings erected or purchased and for the purchasing and installing of equipment for the same. Such bonds, notes or other obligations shall be issued as either serial or term bonds or both, in registered form or with coupons attached, registrable as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, shall be signed by the chairman and the treasurer of the regional board of education and shall mature at such time or times, or contain provisions for mandatory amortization of principal at such time or times, be issued at such discount or bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times, or contain provisions for the method or manner of determining such rate or rates or time or times at which interest is payable, and contain such provisions for redemption before maturity at the option of the issuer or at the option of the holder thereof at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as shall be determined by such board, or by such officer or body to whom the regional board of education delegates the authority to make such determinations, provided that any serial bonds, notes or other obligations shall be so arranged to mature in annual or semiannual installments of principal that shall substantially equalize the aggregate amount of principal and interest due in each annual period commencing with the first annual period in which an installment of principal is due or maturing in annual or semiannual installments of principal no one of which shall exceed by more than fifty per cent the amount of any prior installment, and any term bonds, notes or other obligations, shall be issued with mandatory deposit of sinking fund payments into a sinking fund of amounts sufficient to redeem or amortize the principal of the bonds in annual or semiannual installments that shall substantially equalize the aggregate amount of principal redeemed or amortized and interest due in each annual period commencing with the first annual period in which a mandatory sinking fund payment becomes due, or sufficient to redeem or amortize the principal of the bonds in annual or semiannual installments no one of which shall exceed by more than fifty per cent the amount of any installment. The first installment of any series of bonds shall mature or the first sinking fund payment of any series of bonds shall be due not later than three years from the date of issue of such series and the last installment of such series shall mature or the last sinking fund payment of such series shall be due not later than twenty years therefrom for any grant commitment authorized by the General Assembly pursuant to chapter 173 prior to July 1, 1996, and not later than thirty years therefrom for any grant commitment authorized by the General Assembly pursuant to said chapter on or after July 1, 1996. Such bonds, notes or other obligations when executed, issued and delivered, shall be general obligations of such district and the member towns, according to their terms.

(b) “Annual receipts from taxation” means the receipts from taxation of the member towns for the fiscal year next preceding the beginning of the current fiscal year of such regional school district. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7-374, any regional school district may assume bonds, notes or other obligations of any member town as part of the purchase price of any property for school purposes or issue bonds, notes or other obligations, provided the aggregate indebtedness of such district shall not exceed: (1) In the case of a regional school district serving the same towns as are served by two or more town school districts, two and one-quarter times the annual receipts from taxation or (2) in the case of a regional school district empowered to provide for the member towns all programs under the general supervision and control of the State Board of Education, four and one-half times such annual receipts from taxation. Any regional school district may issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations in an amount not to exceed three and one-half times such annual receipts from taxation less the aggregate indebtedness computed in accordance with section 7-374, for the member towns of such district. In computing the aggregate indebtedness of a regional school district for purposes of this section and section 7-374 there shall be excluded each bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in anticipation of the receipt of (A) payments by a member town or the state for the operation of such district’s schools and (B) proceeds from any state or federal grant for which the district has received a written commitment or for which an allocation has been approved by the State Bond Commission or from a contract with the state, a state agency or another municipality providing for the reimbursement of capital costs but only to the extent such indebtedness can be paid from such proceeds.

(c) When a district has been authorized to issue general obligation bonds, notes or other obligations as provided by this section, the board may authorize, for a period not to exceed ten years, the issue of temporary notes in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds. Notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed ten years. The term of such notes shall not be included in computing the time within which such bonds shall mature, provided such term does not exceed four years. For any series of notes the term of which is extended past the fourth year, the provisions of section 7-378a providing for the retirement from budgeted funds of one-twentieth, or one-thirtieth, as applicable, of the net project cost, the reduction of the term of the bonds when sold and the commencement of the first principal payment of such bonds, shall apply with respect to each year beyond the fourth that the notes are outstanding. The provisions of section 7-373 shall be deemed to apply to such notes. The board, or such officer or body to whom the board delegates the authority to make such determinations, shall determine the date, maturity, interest rate, form, manner of sale and other terms of such notes which shall be general obligations of the regional school district and member towns. Such notes may bear interest or be sold at a discount. The interest or discount on such notes and any renewals thereof and the expense of preparing, issuing and marketing them may be included as a part of the cost of the project for the financing of which such bonds were authorized. Upon the sale of such bonds, the board shall apply immediately the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, to the payment of the principal and interest of all notes issued in anticipation thereof or deposit the proceeds in trust for such purpose with a bank or trust company, which may be the bank or trust company, if any, at which such notes are payable.

(d) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the board may deposit or invest the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations as permitted in section 7-400 or 7-402.

#### Section 10-58a: Default of district in payment on bonds or notes. Withholding of state aid.

Whenever it is established as herein provided that a regional school district, including Regional School District Number 1 of Litchfield County, has defaulted in the payment of the principal or interest, or both, on its bonds or notes, the payment of state aid and assistance to such regional school district pursuant to any statute then in existence shall be withheld by the state. If a holder or owner of any such bond or note of such regional school district files with the State Comptroller a verified statement describing such bond or note and alleging default in the payment thereof or the interest thereon, or both, the Comptroller shall immediately investigate the circumstances of the alleged default, prepare and file in his office a certificate setting forth his finding with respect thereto and serve a copy of such finding, by registered or certified mail, upon the treasurer or chief fiscal officer of such regional school district. Such investigation shall cover the current status with respect to the payment of principal of and interest on all outstanding bonds and notes of such regional school district, and the statement prepared and filed by the Comptroller pursuant to this section shall set forth a description of all bonds and notes of such regional school district found to be in default and the amount of principal and interest thereon past due. Upon the filing of such a certificate in the office of the Comptroller, the Comptroller shall thereafter deduct and withhold from the next succeeding payment of state aid or assistance otherwise due such regional school district such amount as is necessary to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes of such regional school district then in default. If such amount is insufficient to pay all of such principal and interest, said Comptroller shall similarly deduct and withhold from the next succeeding payment of state aid and assistance, otherwise due to any town in such district which is currently in default of its annual payments to such district, such amount as is necessary to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds or notes remaining in default. If all such amounts withheld are insufficient to pay all such principal and interest, the Comptroller shall similarly deduct and withhold from each succeeding payment of state aid or assistance otherwise due such regional school district and such towns such amount or amounts thereof as may be required to pay all of the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes then in default. Payments of state aid or assistance so deducted and withheld shall be forwarded promptly by the Comptroller to the paying agent or agents for the bonds and notes in default for the sole purpose of payment of defaulted principal of and interest on such bonds or notes; provided, if any such payment of state aid or assistance so deducted or withheld is less than the total amount of all principal and interest on such bonds and notes, then the Comptroller shall forward to each paying agent an amount in the proportion that the amount of such bonds and notes in default payable by such paying agent bears to the total amount of the principal of and interest then in default on such bonds and notes of such regional school district. The Comptroller shall promptly notify the treasurer or the chief fiscal officer of such regional school district of any payment or payments made to any paying agent or paying agents of defaulted bonds or notes pursuant to this section. The state of Connecticut hereby covenants with the purchasers, holders and owners from time to time of bonds and notes issued by regional school districts for school purposes that it will not repeal the provisions of this section or amend or modify the same so as to limit or impair the rights and remedies granted hereby; provided nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed as requiring the state to continue the payment of state aid or assistance to any regional school district or town or as limiting or prohibiting the state from repealing or amending any law relating to state aid or assistance, the manner and time of payment or apportionment thereof, or the amount thereof.

(c) If within three months after the Commissioner of Education has specified the date after which the regional board can act only by weighted vote, a plan of representation has not been established for the regional school district, the State Board of Education shall establish a plan of representation for that regional school district and file it with the town clerk of each participating town.

If a regional educational service center is required to draw upon any such credit facility, the amount of each loan made pursuant to such credit facility shall be repaid by the center as provided in such agreement with the provider of the credit facility, but no later than the last date on which the bond, notes or other obligations secured thereby would be required to mature by law. Such regional educational service center may pledge or assign or mortgage any of its income, proceeds, revenues or properties authorized by this section to secure its bonds, notes or other obligations to secure its payment obligations under any agreement entered into pursuant to this section.

If the State Board of Education does not renew a charter, it shall notify the governing council of the charter school of the reasons for such nonrenewal.

(h) The Commissioner of Education may at any time place a charter school on probation if (1) the school has failed to (A) adequately demonstrate student progress, as determined by the commissioner, (B) comply with the terms of its charter or with applicable laws and regulations, (C) achieve measurable progress in reducing racial, ethnic and economic isolation, or (D) maintain its nonsectarian status, or (2) the governing council has demonstrated an inability to provide effective leadership to oversee the operation of the charter school or has not ensured that public funds are expended prudently or in a manner required by law. If a charter school is placed on probation, the commissioner shall provide written notice to the charter school of the reasons for such placement, not later than five days after the placement, and shall require the charter school to file with the Department of Education a corrective action plan acceptable to the commissioner not later than thirty-five days from the date of such placement.

Unless an emergency exists, prior to revoking a charter, the State Board of Education shall provide the governing council of the charter school with a written notice of the reasons for the revocation, including the identification of specific incidents of noncompliance with the law, regulation or charter or other matters warranting revocation of the charter. It shall also provide the governing council with the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for the retention of its charter by providing the State Board of Education or a subcommittee of the board, as determined by the State Board of Education, with a written or oral presentation. Such presentation shall include an opportunity for the governing council to present documentary and testimonial evidence to refute the facts cited by the State Board of Education for the proposed revocation or in justification of its activities. Such opportunity shall not constitute a contested case within the meaning of chapter 54. The State Board of Education shall determine, not later than thirty days after the date of an oral presentation or receipt of a written presentation, whether and when the charter shall be revoked and notify the governing council of the decision and the reasons therefor. A decision to revoke a charter shall not constitute a final decision for purposes of chapter 54. In the event an emergency exists in which the commissioner finds that there is imminent harm to the students attending a charter school, the State Board of Education may immediately revoke the charter of the school, provided the notice concerning the reasons for the revocation is sent to the governing council not later than ten days after the date of revocation and the governing council is provided an opportunity to make a presentation to the board not later than twenty days from the date of such notice.

(k) If in any fiscal year, more than one new state or local charter school is approved pursuant to section 10-66bb and is awaiting funding pursuant to the provisions of this section, the State Board of Education shall determine which school is funded first based on a consideration of the following factors in order of importance as follows: (1) The quality of the proposed program as measured against the criteria required in the charter school application process pursuant to section 10-66bb, (2) whether the applicant has a demonstrated record of academic success by students, (3) whether the school is located in a school district with a demonstrated need for student improvement, and (4) whether the applicant has plans concerning the preparedness of facilities, staffing and outreach to students.

(l) Within available appropriations, the state may provide a grant in an amount not to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars to any newly approved state charter school that assists the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v.

(1) The percentage of the eligible costs for adult education a local board of education shall receive, under the provisions of this section, shall be determined as follows: (A) Each town shall be ranked in descending order from one to one hundred sixty-nine according to such town’s adjusted equalized net grand list per capita, as defined in section 10-261; and (B) based upon such ranking, a percentage of not less than zero or more than sixty-five shall be determined for each town on a continuous scale, except that the percentage for a priority school district pursuant to section 10-266p shall not be less than twenty. Any such percentage shall be increased by seven and one-half percentage points but shall not exceed sixty-five per cent for any local board of education which provides basic adult education programs for adults at facilities operated by or within the general administrative control and supervision of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, provided such adults reside at such facilities.

(2) The percentage of the eligible costs for adult education a regional board of education shall receive under the provisions of this section shall be determined by its ranking. Such ranking shall be determined by (A) multiplying the total population, as defined in section 10-261, of each town in the district by such town’s ranking, as determined in subdivision (1) of this subsection, (B) adding together the figures for each town determined under (A), and (C) dividing the total computed under (B) by the total population of all towns in the district. The ranking of each regional board of education shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and each such board shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as would a town with the same rank, except that the reimbursement percentage for a priority school district pursuant to section 10-266p shall not be less than twenty.

(3) The percentage of the eligible costs for adult education a regional educational service center shall receive under the provisions of this subsection and section 10-66i shall be determined by its ranking.

The ranking of each regional educational service center shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and each such center shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as would a town with the same rank.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (6) of section 10-67, a local or regional board of education or regional educational service center shall be eligible to receive an amount to be paid pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The amount shall equal the eligible expenditures from funds received from private sources by the local or regional board of education, regional educational service center or cooperating eligible entity multiplied by the appropriate percentage, as determined under subsection (a) of this section, provided such amount shall not exceed twenty per cent of the amount received by the local or regional board of education or regional educational service center pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for the previous fiscal year. For payments from private sources to be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to this subsection, (1) based upon estimated eligible costs approved by the Department of Education, the eligible expenditures from local taxes in a fiscal year shall not be less than seventy per cent of the eligible expenditures from local taxes for the previous fiscal year, and (2) the local or regional board of education, regional educational service center or cooperating eligible entity shall provide, not later than a date to be determined by the Commissioner of Education, evidence satisfactory to the commissioner of a written commitment of a payment from a private source. Evidence of actual payment shall be submitted to the commissioner not later than a date established by the commissioner. Upon receipt by a board of education or regional educational service center of state funds pursuant to this subsection attributable to expenditures of a cooperating eligible entity, the board or center shall provide for the distribution of such funds to the cooperating eligible entity for the provision of adult education programs and services pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subsection (a) of section 10-69.

(c) Payments pursuant to this section for each estimated total grant of fifteen hundred dollars or more shall be made during the fiscal year in which such programs are offered as follows: Two-thirds of the grant entitlement based on estimated eligible costs of adult education, included in the approved proposal, in August and the adjusted balance, based on a revised estimate of such eligible costs to be filed with the Commissioner of Education at such time as the commissioner prescribes, in May. Payments pursuant to this section for each estimated total grant of less than fifteen hundred dollars shall be made in a single installment in May of the fiscal year in which such programs are offered, based on a revised estimate of the eligible costs of adult education filed with the Commissioner of Education at such time as the commissioner prescribes. Each recipient of a grant pursuant to this section shall submit a report of actual revenue and expenditures to the Commissioner of Education in such manner and on such forms as the commissioner prescribes on or before the September first immediately following the end of the grant year.

#### Section 10-76d: Duties and powers of boards of education to provide special education programs and services. Determination of eligibility for Medicaid. Development of individualized education program. Planning and placement team meetings. Public agency placements; apportionment of costs. Relationship of insurance to special education costs.

(a)(1) In accordance with the regulations and procedures established by the Commissioner of Education and approved by the State Board of Education, each local or regional board of education shall provide the professional services requisite to identification of children requiring special education, identify each such child within its jurisdiction, determine the eligibility of such children for special education pursuant to sections 10-76a to 10-76h, inclusive, prescribe appropriate educational programs for eligible children, maintain a record thereof and make such reports as the commissioner may require. No child may be required to obtain a prescription for a substance covered by the Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 et seq., as amended from time to time, as a condition of attending school, receiving an evaluation under section 10-76ff or receiving services pursuant to sections 10-76a to 10-76h, inclusive, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time.

(2) Any local or regional board of education, through the planning and placement team established in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Board of Education under this section, may determine a child’s Medicaid enrollment status. In determining Medicaid enrollment status, the planning and placement team shall: (A) Inquire of the parents or guardians of each such child whether the child is enrolled in or may be eligible for Medicaid; and (B) if the child may be eligible for Medicaid, request that the parent or guardian of the child apply for Medicaid. For the purpose of determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services based on a representative cost sampling method, the board of education shall make available documentation of the provision and costs of Medicaid eligible special education and related services for any students receiving such services, regardless of an individual student’s Medicaid enrollment status, to the Commissioner of Social Services or to the commissioner’s authorized agent at such time and in such manner as prescribed. For the purpose of determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services based on an actual cost method, the local or regional board of education shall submit documentation of the costs and utilization of Medicaid eligible special education and related services for all students receiving such services to the Commissioner of Social Services or to the commissioner’s authorized agent at such time and in such manner as prescribed. The commissioner or such agent may use information received from local or regional boards of education for the purposes of (i) ascertaining students’ Medicaid eligibility status, (ii) submitting Medicaid claims, (iii) complying with state and federal audit requirements and (iv) determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services. No child shall be denied special education and related services in the event the parent or guardian refuses to apply for Medicaid.

(3) Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, the Commissioner of Social Services shall make grant payments to local or regional boards of education in amounts representing fifty per cent of the federal portion of Medicaid claims processed for Medicaid eligible special education and related services provided to Medicaid eligible students in the school district. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the commissioner shall exclude any enhanced federal medical assistance percentages in calculating the federal portion of such Medicaid claims processed. Such grant payments shall be made on at least a quarterly basis and may represent estimates of amounts due to local or regional boards of education. Any grant payments made on an estimated basis, including payments made by the Department of Education for the fiscal years prior to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, shall be subsequently reconciled to grant amounts due based upon filed and accepted Medicaid claims and Medicaid rates. If, upon review, it is determined that a grant payment or portion of a grant payment was made for ineligible or disallowed Medicaid claims, the local or regional board of education shall reimburse the Department of Social Services for any grant payment amount received based upon ineligible or disallowed Medicaid claims.

(4) Pursuant to federal law, the Commissioner of Social Services, as the state’s Medicaid agent, shall determine rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection. The Commissioner of Social Services may request and the Commissioner of Education and towns and regional school districts shall provide information as may be necessary to set such rates.

(5) Based on school district special education and related services expenditures, the state’s Medicaid agent shall report and certify to the federal Medicaid authority the state match required by federal law to obtain Medicaid reimbursement of eligible special education and related services costs.

(6) Payments received pursuant to this section shall be paid to the local or regional board of education which has incurred such costs in addition to the funds appropriated by the town to such board for the current fiscal year.

(7) The planning and placement team shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400, et seq., as amended from time to time, develop and update annually a statement of transition service needs for each child requiring special education.

(8) (A) Each local and regional board of education responsible for providing special education and related services to a child or pupil shall notify the parent or guardian of a child who requires or who may require special education, a pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older who requires or who may require special education or a surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, in writing, at least five school days before such board proposes to, or refuses to, initiate or change the child’s or pupil’s identification, evaluation or educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child or pupil.

(B) Upon request by a parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent, the responsible local or regional board of education shall provide such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent an opportunity to meet with a member of the planning and placement team designated by such board prior to the referral planning and placement team meeting at which the assessments and evaluations of the child or pupil who requires or may require special education is presented to such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent for the first time. Such meeting shall be for the sole purpose of discussing the planning and placement team process and any concerns such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent has regarding the child or pupil who requires or may require special education.

(C) Such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent shall be given at least five school days’ prior notice of any planning and placement team meeting conducted for such child or pupil and shall have the right to be present at and participate in and to have advisors of such person’s own choosing and at such person’s own expense to be present at and to participate in all portions of such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, reviewed or revised.

(D) Immediately upon the formal identification of any child as a child requiring special education and at each planning and placement team meeting for such child, the responsible local or regional board of education shall inform the parent or guardian of such child or surrogate parent or, in the case of a pupil who is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older, the pupil of (i) the laws relating to special education, (ii) the rights of such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil under such laws and the regulations adopted by the State Board of Education relating to special education, including the right of a parent, guardian or surrogate parent to withhold from enrolling such child in kindergarten, in accordance with the provisions of section 10-184, and (iii) any relevant information and resources relating to individualized education programs created by the Department of Education. If such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil does not attend a planning and placement team meeting, the responsible local or regional board of education shall mail such information to such person.

(E) Each local and regional board of education shall have in effect at the beginning of each school year an educational program for each child or pupil who has been identified as eligible for special education.

(F) At each initial planning and placement team meeting for a child or pupil, the responsible local or regional board of education shall inform the parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil of the laws relating to physical restraint and seclusion pursuant to chapter 814e and the rights of such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil under such laws and the regulations adopted by the State Board of Education relating to physical restraint and seclusion.

(G) Upon request by a parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent, the responsible local or regional board of education shall provide the results of the assessments and evaluations used in the determination of eligibility for special education for a child or pupil to such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil at least three school days before the referral planning and placement team meeting at which such results of the assessments and evaluations will be discussed for the first time.

(9) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement, when recommended by the planning and placement team and specified on the individualized education program, a service eligible for reimbursement under the Medicaid program shall be deemed to be authorized by a practitioner of the healing arts under 42 CFR 440.130, provided such service is recommended by an appropriately licensed or certified individual and is within the individual’s scope of practice. Certain items of durable medical equipment, recommended pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, may be subject to prior authorization requirements established by the Commissioner of Social Services. Diagnostic and evaluation services eligible for reimbursement under the Medicaid program and recommended by the planning and placement team shall also be deemed to be authorized by a practitioner of the healing arts under 42 CFR 440.130 provided such services are recommended by an appropriately licensed or certified individual and are within the individual’s scope of practice.

(10) The Commissioner of Social Services shall implement the policies and procedures necessary for the purposes of this subsection while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal within twenty days of implementing the policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.

(b) In accordance with the regulations of the State Board of Education, each local and regional board of education shall: (1) Provide special education for school-age children requiring special education who are described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a. The obligation of the school district under this subsection shall terminate when such child is graduated from high school or reaches age twenty-one, whichever occurs first; and (2) provide special education for children requiring special education who are described in subparagraph (A) or (C) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a. The State Board of Education shall define the criteria by which each local or regional board of education shall determine whether a given child is eligible for special education pursuant to this subdivision, and such determination shall be made by the board of education when requested by a parent or guardian, or upon referral by a physician, clinic or social worker, provided the parent or guardian so permits. To meet its obligations under this subdivision, each local or regional board of education may, with the approval of the State Board of Education, make agreements with any private school, agency or institution to provide the necessary preschool special education program, provided such private facility has an existing program which adequately meets the special education needs, according to standards established by the State Board of Education, of the preschool children for whom such local or regional board of education is required to provide such an education and provided such district does not have such an existing program in its public schools. Such private school, agency or institution may be a facility which has not been approved by the Commissioner of Education for special education, provided such private facility is approved by the commissioner as an independent school or licensed by the Department of Public Health as a day care or nursery facility or be both approved and licensed.

(c) Each local or regional board of education may provide special education for children requiring it who are described by subparagraph (B) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a and for other exceptional children for whom provision of special education is not required by law.

(d) To meet its obligations under sections 10-76a to 10-76g, inclusive, any local or regional board of education may make agreements with another such board or subject to the consent of the parent or guardian of any child affected thereby, make agreements with any private school or with any public or private agency or institution, including a group home to provide the necessary programs or services, but no expenditures made pursuant to a contract with a private school, agency or institution for such special education shall be paid under the provisions of section 10-76g, unless (1) such contract includes a description of the educational program and other treatment the child is to receive, a statement of minimal goals and objectives which it is anticipated such child will achieve and an estimated time schedule for returning the child to the community or transferring such child to another appropriate facility, (2) subject to the provisions of this subsection, the educational needs of the child for whom such special education is being provided cannot be met by public school arrangements in the opinion of the commissioner who, before granting approval of such contract for purposes of payment, shall consider such factors as the particular needs of the child, the appropriateness and efficacy of the program offered by such private school, agency or institution, and the economic feasibility of comparable alternatives, and (3) commencing with the 1987-1988 school year and for each school year thereafter, each such private school, agency or institution has been approved for special education by the Commissioner of Education or by the appropriate agency for facilities located out of state, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection or any regulations adopted by the State Board of Education setting placement priorities, placements pursuant to this section and payments under section 10-76g may be made pursuant to such a contract if the public arrangements are more costly than the private school, institution or agency, provided the private school, institution or agency meets the educational needs of the child and its program is appropriate and efficacious. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, nothing in this subsection shall (A) require the removal of a child from a nonapproved facility if the child was placed there prior to July 7, 1987, pursuant to the determination of a planning and placement team that such a placement was appropriate and such placement was approved by the Commissioner of Education, or (B) prohibit the placement of a child at a nonapproved facility if a planning and placement team determines prior to July 7, 1987, that the child be placed in a nonapproved facility for the 1987-1988 school year. Each child placed in a nonapproved facility as described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subdivision (3) of this subsection may continue at the facility provided the planning and placement team or hearing officer appointed pursuant to section 10-76h determines that the placement is appropriate. Expenditures incurred by any local or regional board of education to maintain children in nonapproved facilities as described in said subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of section 10-76g. Any local or regional board of education may enter into a contract with the owners or operators of any sheltered workshop or rehabilitation center for provision of an education occupational training program for children requiring special education who are at least sixteen years of age, provided such workshop or institution shall have been approved by the appropriate state agency. Whenever any child is identified by a local or regional board of education as a child requiring special education and said board of education determines that the requirements for special education could be met by a program provided within the district or by agreement with another board of education except for the child’s need for services other than educational services such as medical, psychiatric or institutional care or services, said board may meet its obligation to furnish special education for such child by paying the reasonable cost of special education instruction in a private school, hospital or other institution provided said board or the commissioner concurs that placement in such institution is necessary and proper and no state institution is available to meet such child’s needs.

(e) (1) Any local or regional board of education which provides special education pursuant to any mandates in this section shall provide transportation, to and from, but not beyond the curb of, the residence of the child, unless otherwise agreed upon by the board and the parent or guardian of the child, tuition, room and board and other items necessary to the provision of such special education except for children who are placed in a residential facility because they need services other than educational services, in which case the financial responsibility of the school district and payment to such district shall be limited to the reasonable costs of special education instruction as defined in the regulations of the State Board of Education. If a hearing board, pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-76h, rejects the educational program prescribed by the local or regional board of education and determines that a placement by a parent or guardian was appropriate, the local or regional board of education shall reimburse the parent or guardian for the reasonable costs incurred for the provision of special education pursuant to this section from the initiation of review procedures as provided by said section 10-76h.

(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “public agency” includes the offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the general statutes, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1987, and each fiscal year thereafter, whenever a public agency, other than a local or regional board of education, the State Board of Education or the Superior Court acting pursuant to section 10-76h, places a child in a foster home, group home, hospital, state institution, receiving home, custodial institution or any other residential or day treatment facility, and such child requires special education, the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child would otherwise be attending school or, if no such board can be identified, the local or regional board of education of the town where the child is placed, shall provide the requisite special education and related services to such child in accordance with the provisions of this section. Within one business day of such a placement by the Department of Children and Families or offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe, said department or offices shall orally notify the local or regional board of education responsible for providing special education and related services to such child of such placement. The department or offices shall provide written notification to such board of such placement within two business days of the placement. Such local or regional board of education shall convene a planning and placement team meeting for such child within thirty days of the placement and shall invite a representative of the Department of Children and Families or offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe to participate in such meeting. (A) The local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction such child would otherwise be attending school shall be financially responsible for the reasonable costs of such special education and related services in an amount equal to the lesser of one hundred per cent of the costs of such education or the average per pupil educational costs of such board of education for the prior fiscal year, determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-76f. The State Board of Education shall pay on a current basis, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any costs in excess of such local or regional board’s basic contributions paid by such board of education in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (B) Whenever a child is placed pursuant to this subdivision, on or after July 1, 1995, by the Department of Children and Families and the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction such child would otherwise be attending school cannot be identified, the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child attended school or in whose district the child resided at the time of removal from the home by said department shall be responsible for the reasonable costs of special education and related services provided to such child, for one calendar year or until the child is committed to the state pursuant to section 46b-129 or 46b-140 or is returned to the child’s parent or guardian, whichever is earlier. If the child remains in such placement beyond one calendar year the Department of Children and Families shall be responsible for such costs. During the period the local or regional board of education is responsible for the reasonable cost of special education and related services pursuant to this subparagraph, the board shall be responsible for such costs in an amount equal to the lesser of one hundred per cent of the costs of such education and related services or the average per pupil educational costs of such board of education for the prior fiscal year, determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-76f. The State Board of Education shall pay on a current basis, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any costs in excess of such local or regional board’s basic contributions paid by such board of education in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. The costs for services other than educational shall be paid by the state agency which placed the child. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the school districts established within the Department of Children and Families, pursuant to section 17a-37 or the Department of Correction, pursuant to section 18-99a, provided in any case in which special education is being provided at a private residential institution, including the residential components of regional educational service centers, to a child for whom no local or regional board of education can be found responsible under subsection (b) of this section, Unified School District #2 shall provide the special education and related services and be financially responsible for the reasonable costs of such special education instruction for such children. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2007, inclusive, and for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, to June 30, 2015, inclusive, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this subdivision shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for the purposes of this subdivision for such year.

(3) Payment for children who require special education and who reside on state-owned or leased property, and who are not the educational responsibility of the unified school districts established pursuant to section 17a-37 or section 18-99a, shall be made in the following manner: The State Board of Education shall pay to the school district which is responsible for providing instruction for each such child pursuant to the provisions of this subsection one hundred per cent of the reasonable costs of such instruction. In the fiscal year following such payment, the State Board of Education shall deduct from the special education grant due the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child would otherwise be attending school, where such board has been identified, the amount for which such board would otherwise have been financially responsible pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection. No such deduction shall be made for any school district which is responsible for providing special education instruction for children whose parents or legal guardians do not reside within such district. The amount deducted shall be included as a net cost of special education by the Department of Education for purposes of the state’s special education grant calculated pursuant to section 10-76g. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2005, and for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2013, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this subdivision shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for the purposes of this subdivision for such year.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall provide regular education and special education and related services to eligible residents in facilities operated by the department who are eighteen to twenty-one years of age. In the case of a resident who requires special education, the department shall provide the requisite identification and evaluation of such resident in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department shall be financially responsible for the provision of educational services to eligible residents. The Departments of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Children and Families and Education shall develop and implement an interagency agreement which specifies the role of each agency in ensuring the provision of appropriate education services to eligible residents in accordance with this section. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall be responsible for one hundred per cent of the reasonable costs of such educational services provided to eligible residents of such facilities.

(5) Application for the grant to be paid by the state for costs in excess of the local or regional board of education’s basic contribution shall be made by such board of education by filing with the State Board of Education, in such manner as prescribed by the Commissioner of Education, annually on or before December first a statement of the cost of providing special education, as defined in subdivision (2) of this subsection, for a child of the board placed by a state agency in accordance with the provisions of said subdivision or, where appropriate, a statement of the cost of providing educational services other than special educational services pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) or (g) of section 10-253, provided a board of education may submit, not later than March first, claims for additional children or costs not included in the December filing. Payment by the state for such excess costs shall be made to the local or regional board of education as follows: Seventy-five per cent of the cost in February and the balance in May. The amount due each town pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and the amount due to each town as tuition from other towns pursuant to this section shall be paid to the treasurer of each town entitled to such aid, provided the treasurer shall treat such grant or tuition received, or a portion of such grant or tuition, which relates to special education expenditures incurred pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection in excess of such board’s budgeted estimate of such expenditures, as a reduction in expenditures by crediting such expenditure account, rather than town revenue. The state shall notify the local or regional board of education when payments are made to the treasurer of the town pursuant to this subdivision.

(f) No children placed out primarily for special education services shall be placed in a private school, agency or institution outside of the state, except when in the opinion of the Commissioner of Education it is determined that: (1) No public or approved private facility which can reasonably provide appropriate special education programs for such children is available in the state; (2) no public or approved private facility which can reasonably provide appropriate special education programs for such children is available in the state and the out-of-state placement is required for a period of time not to exceed two years, during which time the local or regional board of education responsible for providing such children with a special education shall develop an appropriate special education program or cause such program to be developed within the state; or (3) an out-of-state placement is more economically feasible than an existing special education program in the state or any such program that could be developed within the state within a reasonable period of time. No placement in an out-of-state private special education school, agency or facility shall be approved unless such school, agency or facility first agrees in writing to submit to the state Department of Education any such financial program and student progress reports as the commissioner may require for the purpose of making an annual determination as to the economic feasibility and program adequacy of the special education program provided. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to children placed out primarily for services other than educational services as described in subsection (d) of this section.

(g) (1) Each local or regional board of education shall review annually and make a report as to the progress of each child for whom such board is obligated to provide a special education and who receives special education services in any private school, agency or institution and shall, upon request of the commissioner, submit such reports to the State Board of Education.

(a)(1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1984, and each fiscal year thereafter, in any case in which special education is being provided at a private residential institution, including the residential components of regional educational service centers, to a child for whom no local or regional board of education can be found responsible under subsection (b) of section 10-76d, the Department of Children and Families shall pay the costs of special education to such institution pursuant to its authority under sections 17a-1 to 17a-26, inclusive, 17a-28 to 17a-49, inclusive, 17a-52 and 17b-251. (2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, and each fiscal year thereafter, any local or regional board of education which provides special education and related services for any child (A) who is placed by a public agency, including, but not limited to, offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe, in a private residential facility or who is placed in a facility or institution operated by the Department of Children and Families and who receives such special education at a program operated by a regional education service center or program operated by a local or regional board of education, and (B) for whom no local or regional board of education can be found responsible under subsection (b) of section 10-76d, shall be eligible to receive one hundred per cent of the reasonable costs of special education for such child as defined in the regulations of the State Board of Education. Any such board eligible for payment shall file with the Department of Education, in such manner as prescribed by the Commissioner of Education, annually, on or before December first a statement of the cost of providing special education for such child, provided a board of education may submit, not later than March first, claims for additional children or costs not included in the December filing. Payment by the state for such costs shall be made to the local or regional board of education as follows: Seventy-five per cent of the cost in February and the balance in May.

(b) Any local or regional board of education which provides special education pursuant to the provisions of sections 10-76a to 10-76g, inclusive, for any exceptional child described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a, under its jurisdiction, excluding (1) children placed by a state agency for whom a board of education receives payment pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 10-76d, and (2) children who require special education, who reside on state-owned or leased property, and who are not the educational responsibility of the unified school districts established pursuant to sections 17a-37 and 18-99a, shall be financially responsible for the reasonable costs of special education instruction, as defined in the regulations of the State Board of Education, in an amount equal to (A) for any fiscal year commencing prior to July 1, 2005, five times the average per pupil educational costs of such board of education for the prior fiscal year, determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-76f, and (B) for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2005, and each fiscal year thereafter, four and one-half times such average per pupil educational costs of such board of education.

Any amounts paid by the State Board of Education on a current basis pursuant to this subsection shall not be reimbursable in the subsequent year. Application for such grant shall be made by filing with the Department of Education, in such manner as prescribed by the commissioner, annually on or before December first a statement of the cost of providing special education pursuant to this subsection, provided a board of education may submit, not later than March first, claims for additional children or costs not included in the December filing. Payment by the state for such excess costs shall be made to the local or regional board of education as follows: Seventy-five per cent of the cost in February and the balance in May. The amount due each town pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be paid to the treasurer of each town entitled to such aid, provided the treasurer shall treat such grant, or a portion of the grant, which relates to special education expenditures incurred in excess of such town’s board of education budgeted estimate of such expenditures, as a reduction in expenditures by crediting such expenditure account, rather than town revenue. Such expenditure account shall be so credited no later than thirty days after receipt by the treasurer of necessary documentation from the board of education indicating the amount of such special education expenditures incurred in excess of such town’s board of education budgeted estimate of such expenditures.

Such grant shall be equal to the product of a town’s eligible excess costs and the town’s base aid ratio, as defined in section 10-262f, provided each town’s grant shall be adjusted proportionately if necessary to stay within the appropriation. Payment pursuant to this subsection shall be made in June. For purposes of this subsection, a town’s eligible excess costs are the difference between its net costs of special education and the amount the town would have expended if it spent at the state-wide average rate.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2007, inclusive, and for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, to June 30, 2015, inclusive, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this section, except grants paid in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2006, and June 30, 2007, and for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, to June 30, 2015, inclusive, shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for the purposes of this section for such year.

#### Section 10-76h: Special education hearing and review procedure. Mediation of disputes.

(a)(1) A parent or guardian of a child requiring special education and related services pursuant to sections 10-76a to 10-76g, inclusive, a pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older requiring such services, a surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, or the Commissioner of Children and Families, or a designee of said commissioner, on behalf of any such child in the custody of said commissioner, may request a hearing of the local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing such services whenever such board or district proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child or pupil. Such request shall be made by sending a written request to such board or district with a copy to the Department of Education.

(2) The local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing special education and related services for a child or pupil requiring such services under sections 10-76a to 10-76g, inclusive, may request, upon written notice to the parent or guardian of such child, the pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older, the surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, or the Commissioner of Children and Families, or a designee of said commissioner, on behalf of any such child or pupil in the custody of said commissioner, a hearing concerning the decision of the planning and placement team established pursuant to section 10-76d, whenever such board or district proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education placement to such child or pupil, including, but not limited to, refusal of the parent or guardian, pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older or the surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, to give consent for initial evaluation or reevaluation or the withdrawal of such consent. The local or regional board of education or unified school district shall provide a copy of the request to the Department of Education. In the event a planning and placement team proposes private placement for a child or pupil who requires or may require special education and related services and the parent, guardian, pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older or surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g withholds or revokes consent for such placement, the local or regional board of education shall request a hearing in accordance with this section and may request mediation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, provided such action may be taken only in the event such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent has consented to the initial receipt of special education and related services and subsequent to the initial placement of the child, the local or regional board of education seeks a private placement. For purposes of this section, a “local or regional board of education or unified school district” includes any public agency which is responsible for the provision of special education and related services to children requiring special education and related services.

(3) The request for a hearing shall contain a statement of the specific issues in dispute.

(4) A party shall have two years to request a hearing from the time the board of education proposed or refused to initiate or change the identification, evaluation or educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education placement to such child or pupil provided, if the parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent is not given notice of the procedural safeguards, in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Board of Education, including notice of the limitations contained in this section, such two-year limitation shall be calculated from the time notice of the safeguards is properly given.

(b) Upon receipt of a written request for a special education hearing made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Department of Education shall appoint an impartial hearing officer who shall schedule a hearing which shall be held and the decision written and mailed not later than forty-five days after the commencement of the hearing pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time. An extension of the forty-five-day time limit may be granted by the hearing officer at the request of either party to the hearing.

(c) (1) The Department of Education shall provide training to hearing officers in administrative hearing procedures, including due process, and in the special educational needs of children. Hearing officers and members of hearing boards shall not be employees of the Department of Education or any local or regional board of education, unified school district or public agency involved in the education or care of the child. A person who is paid to serve as a hearing officer is not deemed to be an employee of the Department of Education. No person who participated in the previous identification, evaluation or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child or pupil nor any member of the board of education of the school district under review, shall be a hearing officer or a member of a hearing board.

(2) Both parties shall participate in a prehearing conference to resolve the issues in dispute, if possible and narrow the scope of the issues. Each party to the hearing shall disclose, not later than five business days prior to the date the hearing commences, (A) documentary evidence such party plans to present at the hearing and a list of witnesses such party plans to call at the hearing, and (B) all completed evaluations and recommendations based on the offering party’s evaluations that the party intends to use at the hearing. Except for good cause shown, the hearing officer shall limit each party to such documentary evidence and witnesses as were properly disclosed and are relevant to the issues in dispute. A hearing officer may bar any party who fails to comply with the requirements concerning disclosure of evaluations and recommendations from introducing any undisclosed evaluation or recommendation at the hearing without the consent of the other party.

(3) The hearing officer or board shall hear testimony relevant to the issues in dispute offered by the party requesting the hearing and any other party directly involved, and may hear any additional testimony the hearing officer or board deems relevant. The hearing officer or board may require a complete and independent evaluation or prescription of educational programs by qualified persons, the cost of which shall be paid by the board of education or the unified school district. The hearing officer or board shall cause all formal sessions of the hearing and review to be recorded in order to provide a verbatim record.

(d) (1) The hearing officer or board shall have the authority (A) to confirm, modify, or reject the identification, evaluation or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child or pupil, (B) to determine the appropriateness of an educational placement where the parent or guardian of a child requiring special education or the pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older, has placed the child or pupil in a program other than that prescribed by the planning and placement team, or (C) to prescribe alternate special educational programs for the child or pupil. If the parent or guardian of such a child who previously received special education and related services from the district enrolls the child, or the pupil who previously received special education and related services from the district enrolls in a private elementary or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the district, a hearing officer may, in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time, require the district to reimburse the parents or the pupil for the cost of that enrollment if the hearing officer finds that the district had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child or pupil in a timely manner prior to that enrollment. In the case where a parent or guardian, or pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older, or a surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, has refused consent for initial evaluation or reevaluation, the hearing officer or board may order an initial evaluation or reevaluation without the consent of such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent except that if the parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent appeals such decision pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection, the child or pupil may not be evaluated or placed pending the disposition of the appeal. The hearing officer or board shall inform the parent or guardian, or the emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older, or the surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, or the Commissioner of Children and Families, as the case may be, and the board of education of the school district or the unified school district of the decision in writing and mail such decision not later than forty-five days after the commencement of the hearing pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time, except that a hearing officer or board may grant specific extensions of such forty-five-day period in order to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. The hearing officer may include in the decision a comment on the conduct of the proceedings. The findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision shall be written without personally identifiable information concerning such child or pupil, so that such decisions may be available for public inspections pursuant to sections 4-167 and 4-180a.

(2) If the local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing special education for such child or pupil requiring special education does not take action on the findings or prescription of the hearing officer or board within fifteen days after receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the findings or prescriptions of the hearing officer or board. Such action may include application to the Superior Court for injunctive relief to compel such local or regional board or school district to implement the findings or prescription of the hearing officer or board without the necessity of establishing irreparable harm or inadequate remedy at law.

(3) If the hearing officer or board upholds the local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing special education and related services for such child or pupil who requires or may require special education on the issue of evaluation, reevaluation or placement in a private school or facility, such board or district may evaluate or provide such services to the child or pupil without the consent of the parent or guardian, pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older, or the surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, subject to an appeal pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.

(4) Appeals from the decision of the hearing officer or board shall be taken in the manner set forth in section 4-183, except the court shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-183, such appeal shall be taken to the judicial district wherein the child or pupil resides. In the event of an appeal, upon request and at the expense of the State Board of Education, said board shall supply a copy of the transcript of the formal sessions of the hearing officer or board to the parent or guardian or the emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older or surrogate parent or said commissioner and to the board of education of the school district or the unified school district.

(e) Hearing officers and members of the hearing board shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as established by the State Board of Education.

(f) (1) In lieu of proceeding directly to a hearing, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the parties may agree in writing to request the Commissioner of Education to appoint a state mediator. Upon the receipt of a written request for mediation, signed by both parties, the commissioner shall appoint a mediator knowledgeable in the fields and areas significant to the review of the special educational needs of the child or pupil. The mediator shall attempt to resolve the issues in a manner which is acceptable to the parties. The mediator shall certify in writing to the Department of Education and to the parties whether the mediation was successful or unsuccessful.

(2) If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, either party may proceed to a hearing.

#### Section 10-76ff: Procedures for determining if a child requires special education.

(a) Each local and regional board of education shall, without delay, follow the procedures outlined in this section and in accordance with applicable federal law and regulations in determining if a child requires special education and related services, as defined in section 10-76a. (1) In conducting an evaluation of the child, the local or regional board of education shall: (A) Use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental and academic information, including information provided by the child’s parent or guardian, that may assist in determining (i) whether the child is a child, (I) who requires special education and related services pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (C) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a, (II) whose disability has an adverse effect on his educational performance, and (III) who, by reason of such adverse effect requires special education and related services, and (ii) the content of the child’s individualized education program, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general curriculum or, for preschool children, to participate in appropriate activities; (B) not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and (C) use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors. (2) Each local and regional board of education shall ensure that: (A) Assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess the child are (i) selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis, and (ii) provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally and functionally, unless it is not feasible to so provide or administer; (B) assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child (i) are used for purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable, (ii) are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel, and (iii) are administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of such tests; (C) the child is assessed in all areas of suspected disability; (D) assessment tools and strategies that provide relevant information that directly assists persons in determining the educational needs of the child are provided; and (E) assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from one school district to another school district in the same academic year are coordinated with such children’s prior and subsequent schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as possible, to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations. (3) In accordance with section 10-76d and applicable federal law and regulations, upon completion of administration of assessments and other evaluation measures, the determination of whether the child is a child requiring special education and related services shall be made by a team consisting of qualified professionals and the parent or guardian of the child and a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation for such determination shall be given to the parent or guardian of the child. (4) The local or regional board of education shall not determine that a child requires special education and related services if the dominant factor for determining eligibility is (A) a lack of instruction in reading, including the essential components of reading instruction, as defined in Section 1208(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or mathematics or limited English proficiency, or (B) evidence that the child’s behavior violates the school’s disciplinary policies or evidence that is derived from the contents of discipline records.

(b) (1) The planning and placement team, as part of an initial evaluation, if appropriate, and as part of any reevaluations, shall review existing evaluation data on the child, including evaluations and information provided by the parent or guardian or the child, classroom-based assessments and observations and teacher and related services provider observations. On the basis of such review, and input from the child’s parent or guardian, the planning and placement team shall identify what additional data, if any, is needed to determine: (A) Whether the child has a particular category of disability, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to have such a disability; (B) the present levels of performance and educational needs of the child; (C) whether the child needs special education and related services, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to need special education and related services or whether the child is able to be served within the regular education program with existing supplemental services, available in the school district; and (D) whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the individualized education program of the child and to participate, as appropriate, in the general curriculum. (2) The local or regional board of education shall administer such tests and other evaluation materials as may be needed to produce the data identified by the planning and placement team pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. (3) If the planning and placement team decides that no additional data is needed to determine that the child continues to be a child requiring special education and related services, the local or regional board of education shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of (A) the decision and the reasons for it, and (B) the right of the parent or guardian to request an assessment to determine whether the child continues to be a child requiring special education and related services. The local or regional board of education shall not be required to conduct such an assessment unless requested to do so by the parent or guardian of the child. (4) A local or regional board of education shall evaluate a child identified as requiring special education and related services, in accordance with this section, prior to determining that such child no longer requires such special education or related services, except that such evaluation shall not be required before the termination of a child’s eligibility for special education due to graduation from high school with a regular education diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility for a free appropriate public education pursuant to state regulations. For a child whose eligibility for special education terminates due to graduation from high school with a regular high school diploma or such child exceeds the age of eligibility for a free appropriate public education, the local or regional board of education shall provide the child with a summary of the child’s academic achievement and functional performance, which shall include recommendations on how to assist the child in meeting the child’s postsecondary goals.

(c) The use of the word disability pursuant to this section shall not be the basis for limiting the services or programs, including regular education, available to such child.

#### Section 10-145f: Testing for prospective teachers.

(a) No person shall be formally admitted to a State Board of Education approved teacher preparation program until such person has achieved satisfactory scores on the state reading, writing and mathematics competency examination prescribed by and administered under the direction of the State Board of Education, or has qualified for a waiver of such test based on criteria established by the State Board of Education.

(b) (1) Any person who does not hold a valid certificate pursuant to section 10-145b shall (A) achieve satisfactory scores on the state reading, writing and mathematics competency examination prescribed by and administered under the direction of the State Board of Education, or qualify for a waiver of such test based on criteria approved by the State Board of Education, and (B) achieve a satisfactory evaluation on the appropriate State Board of Education approved subject area assessment in order to be eligible for a certificate pursuant to said section unless such assessment has not been approved by the State Board of Education at the time of application, in which case the applicant shall not be denied a certificate solely because of the lack of an evaluation on such assessment. A person who holds a valid school administrator certificate in another state that is at least equivalent to an initial educator certificate, pursuant to section 10-145b, as determined by the State Board of Education, and has successfully completed three years of experience as a school administrator in a public school in another state or in a nonpublic school approved by the appropriate state board of education during the ten-year period prior to the date of application for a certificate in a school administration endorsement area shall not be required to meet the state reading, writing and mathematics competency examination.

(2) Any person applying for an additional certification endorsement shall achieve a satisfactory evaluation on the appropriate State Board of Education approved subject area assessment in order to be eligible for such additional endorsement, unless such assessment has not been approved by the State Board of Education at the time of application, in which case the applicant shall not be denied the additional endorsement solely because of the lack of an evaluation on such assessment.

(3) On and after July 1, 1992, any teacher who held a valid teaching certificate but whose certificate lapsed and who had completed all requirements for the issuance of a new certificate pursuant to section 10-145b, except for filing an application for such certificate, prior to the date on which the lapse occurred, may file, within one year of the date on which the lapse occurred, an application with the Commissioner of Education for the issuance of such certificate. Upon the filing of such an application, the commissioner may grant such certificate and such certificate shall be retroactive to the date on which the lapse occurred, provided the commissioner finds that the lapse of the certificate occurred as a result of a hardship or extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. If such teacher has attained tenure and is reemployed by the same board of education in any equivalent unfilled position for which the person is qualified as a result of the issuance of a certificate pursuant to this subdivision, the lapse period shall not constitute a break in employment for such person reemployed and shall be used for the purpose of calculating continuous employment pursuant to section 10-151. If such teacher has not attained tenure, the time unemployed due to the lapse of a certificate shall not be counted toward tenure, except that if such teacher is reemployed by the same board of education as a result of the issuance of a certificate pursuant to this subdivision, such teacher may count the previous continuous employment immediately prior to the lapse towards tenure. Using information provided by the Teachers’ Retirement Board, the Department of Education shall annually notify each local or regional board of education of the name of each teacher employed by such board of education whose provisional certificate will expire during the period of twelve months following such notice. Upon receipt of such notice the superintendent of each local and regional board of education shall notify each such teacher in writing, at such teacher’s last known address, that the teacher’s provisional certificate will expire.

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, to be eligible for a certificate to teach subjects for which a bachelor’s degree is not required, any applicant who is otherwise eligible for certification in such endorsement areas shall be entitled to a certificate without having met the requirements of the competency examination and subject area assessment pursuant to this subsection for a period not to exceed two years, except that for a certificate to teach skilled trades or trade-related or occupational subjects, the commissioner may waive the requirement that the applicant take the competency examination. The commissioner may, upon the showing of good cause, extend the certificate.

(5) On and after July 1, 2011, any person applying for a certification in the endorsement area of elementary education shall achieve a satisfactory evaluation on the appropriate State Board of Education approved mathematics assessment in order to be eligible for such elementary education endorsement.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and section 10-145b, the following persons shall be eligible for a nonrenewable temporary certificate: (1) A person who has resided in a state other than Connecticut during the year immediately preceding application for certification in Connecticut and meets the requirements for certification, excluding successful completion of the competency examination and subject matter assessment, if such person holds current teacher certification in a state other than Connecticut and has completed at least one year of successful teaching in another state in a public school or a nonpublic school approved by the appropriate state board of education, (2) a person who has graduated from a teacher preparation program at a college or university outside of the state and regionally accredited, and meets the requirements for certification, excluding successful completion of the competency examination and subject matter assessment, and (3) a person hired by a charter school after July first in any school year for a teaching position that school year, provided the person hired after said date could reasonably be expected to complete the requirements prescribed in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 10-145b. The nonrenewable temporary certificate shall be valid for one year from the date it is issued.

(d) Any person who is first issued a certificate valid after July 1, 1989, or who is reissued a certificate after July 1, 1989, shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, be required to achieve a satisfactory evaluation on a professional knowledge clinical assessment not later than the end of the second year of teaching in a public school if hired prior to January first or, if hired on or after January first, not later than the end of the second full school year of teaching following the year in which such person was hired in order to retain the certificate. The commissioner (1) may waive the requirement that such satisfactory evaluation on a professional knowledge clinical assessment be achieved upon a determination that such assessment is not valid for the person’s teaching assignment, or (2) upon a showing of good cause, may extend the time limit for the assessment for a period of time not exceeding two years. The requirement of a clinical assessment shall not apply to any such person who has completed at least three years of successful teaching in a public school or a nonpublic school approved by the appropriate state board of education during the ten years immediately preceding the date of application or who successfully taught with a provisional teaching certificate during the year immediately preceding an application for a provisional educator certificate as an employee of a local or regional board of education or facility approved for special education by the State Board of Education. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the State Board of Education may reissue an initial educator certificate to a person who held such certificate and did not achieve a satisfactory evaluation on a professional knowledge clinical assessment provided the person submits evidence demonstrating significant intervening study and experience, in accordance with standards established by the State Board of Education.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any person who holds a valid teaching certificate that is at least equivalent to an initial educator certificate, as determined by the State Board of Education, and such certificate is issued by a state other than Connecticut in the subject area or endorsement area for which such person is seeking certification in Connecticut shall not be required to successfully complete the competency examination and subject matter assessment pursuant to this section, if such person has either (1) successfully completed at least three years of teaching experience or service in the endorsement area for which such person is seeking certification in Connecticut in the past ten years in a public school or a nonpublic school approved by the appropriate state board of education in such other state, or (2) holds a master’s degree or higher in the subject area for which such person is seeking certification in Connecticut.

For purposes of calculating continuous employment towards tenure, the following shall apply: (i) For a teacher who has not attained tenure, two school months of part-time continuous employment by such teacher shall equal one school month of full-time continuous employment except, for a teacher employed in a part-time position at a salary rate of less than twenty-five per cent of the salary rate of a teacher in such position, if such position were full-time, three school months of part-time continuous employment shall equal one school month of full-time continuous employment; (ii) a teacher who has not attained tenure shall not count layoff time towards tenure, except that if such teacher is reemployed by the same board of education within five calendar years of the layoff, such teacher may count the previous continuous employment immediately prior to the layoff towards tenure; (iii) a teacher who has not attained tenure shall not count authorized leave time towards tenure if such time exceeds ninety student school days in any one school year, provided only the student school days worked that year by such teacher shall count towards tenure and shall be computed on the basis of eighteen student school days or the greater fraction thereof equaling one school month; and (iv) for a teacher who has not attained tenure and who is employed by a local or regional board of education that enters into a cooperative arrangement pursuant to section 10-158a, such teacher may count the previous continuous employment with such board immediately prior to such cooperative arrangement towards tenure.

(C) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (D) and (E) of this subdivision, any teacher who has attained tenure with any one board of education and whose employment with such board ends for any reason and who is reemployed by such board or is subsequently employed by any other board, shall attain tenure after completion of twenty school months of continuous employment, provided the superintendent offers the teacher a contract to return for the following school year on the basis of effective practice as informed by performance evaluations conducted pursuant to section 10-151b.

If such board rejects such nominations, the superintendent shall submit to such board other nominations and such board may employ teachers from the persons so nominated and shall accept or reject such nominations not later than one month from their submission. Whenever a superintendent offers a teacher who has not attained tenure a contract to return for another year of employment, such offer shall be based on records of evaluations pursuant to subsection (a) of section 10-151b. The contract of employment of a teacher shall be in writing.

(c) The contract of employment of a teacher who has not attained tenure may be terminated at any time for any of the reasons enumerated in subdivisions (1) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (d) of this section; otherwise the contract of such teacher shall be continued into the next school year unless such teacher receives written notice by May first in one school year that such contract will not be renewed for the following year. Upon the teacher’s written request, not later than three calendar days after such teacher receives such notice of nonrenewal or termination, a notice of nonrenewal or termination shall be supplemented not later than four calendar days after receipt of the request by a statement of the reason or reasons for such nonrenewal or termination. Such teacher, upon written request filed with the board of education not later than ten calendar days after the receipt of notice of termination, or nonrenewal shall be entitled to a hearing, except as provided in this subsection, (1) before the board, or (2) if indicated in such request and if designated by the board, before an impartial hearing officer chosen by the teacher and the superintendent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.

Any such teacher whose contract is terminated for the reasons enumerated in subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection (d) of this section shall have the right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section.

(d) The contract of employment of a teacher who has attained tenure shall be continued from school year to school year, except that it may be terminated at any time for one or more of the following reasons: (1) Inefficiency, incompetence or ineffectiveness, provided, if a teacher is notified on or after July 1, 2014, that termination is under consideration due to incompetence or ineffectiveness, the determination of incompetence or ineffectiveness is based on evaluation of the teacher using teacher evaluation guidelines established pursuant to section 10-151b; (2) insubordination against reasonable rules of the board of education; (3) moral misconduct; (4) disability, as shown by competent medical evidence; (5) elimination of the position to which the teacher was appointed or loss of a position to another teacher, if no other position exists to which such teacher may be appointed if qualified, provided such teacher, if qualified, shall be appointed to a position held by a teacher who has not attained tenure, and provided further that determination of the individual contract or contracts of employment to be terminated shall be made in accordance with either (A) a provision for a layoff procedure agreed upon by the board of education and the exclusive employees’ representative organization, or (B) in the absence of such agreement, a written policy of the board of education; or (6) other due and sufficient cause. Nothing in this section or in any other section of the general statutes or of any special act shall preclude a board of education from making an agreement with an exclusive bargaining representative which contains a recall provision.

A board of education may designate a subcommittee of three or more board members to conduct hearings and submit written findings and recommendations to the board for final disposition in the case of teachers whose contracts are terminated. Such hearing shall commence not later than fifteen calendar days after receipt of such request, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension, not to exceed fifteen calendar days (A) before the board of education or a subcommittee of the board, or (B) if indicated in such request or if designated by the board before an impartial hearing officer chosen by the teacher and the superintendent. If the parties are unable to agree upon the choice of a hearing officer not later than five calendar days after the decision to use a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall be selected with the assistance of the American Arbitration Association using its expedited selection process and in accordance with its rules for selection of a neutral arbitrator in grievance arbitration. If the hearing officer is not selected with the assistance of such association after five days, the hearing shall be held before the board of education or a subcommittee of the board. When the reason for termination is incompetence or ineffectiveness, the hearing shall (i) address the question of whether the performance evaluation ratings of the teacher were determined in good faith in accordance with the program adopted by the local or regional board of education pursuant to section 10-151b and were reasonable in light of the evidence presented, and (ii) be limited to twelve total hours of evidence and testimony, with each side allowed not more than six hours to present evidence and testimony except the board, subcommittee of the board or impartial hearing officer may extend the time period for evidence and testimony at the hearing when good cause is shown. Not later than forty-five calendar days after receipt of the request for a hearing, the subcommittee of the board or hearing officer, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension not to exceed fifteen calendar days, shall submit written findings and a recommendation to the board of education as to the disposition of the charges against the teacher and shall send a copy of such findings and recommendation to the teacher. The board of education shall give the teacher concerned its written decision not later than fifteen calendar days after receipt of the written recommendation of the subcommittee or hearing officer. Each party shall share equally the fee of the hearing officer and all other costs incidental to the hearing. If the hearing is before the board of education, the board shall render its decision not later than fifteen calendar days after the close of such hearing and shall send a copy of its decision to the teacher. The hearing shall be public if the teacher so requests or the board, subcommittee or hearing officer so designates. The teacher concerned shall have the right to appear with counsel at the hearing, whether public or private. A copy of a transcript of the proceedings of the hearing shall be furnished by the board of education, upon written request by the teacher within fifteen days after the board’s decision, provided the teacher shall assume the cost of any such copy. Nothing herein contained shall deprive a board of education or superintendent of the power to suspend a teacher from duty immediately when serious misconduct is charged without prejudice to the rights of the teacher as otherwise provided in this section.

(e) Any teacher aggrieved by the decision of a board of education after a hearing as provided in subsection (d) of this section may appeal therefrom, not later than thirty calendar days after such decision, to the Superior Court. Such appeal shall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as is prescribed for civil actions brought to said court. Any such appeal shall be a privileged case to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as is practicable. The board of education shall file with the court a copy of the complete transcript of the proceedings of the hearing and the minutes of board of education meetings relating to such termination, including the vote of the board on the termination, together with such other documents, or certified copies thereof, as shall constitute the record of the case. The court, upon such appeal, shall review the proceedings of such hearing. The court, upon such appeal and hearing thereon, may affirm or reverse the decision appealed from in accordance with subsection (j) of section 4-183. Costs shall not be allowed against the board of education unless it appears to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from.

The commissioner shall notify the local or regional board on or before the third day following receipt of the intervening petition, and such board shall post notice of the intervening petition within three days following receipt thereof. No intervening petition shall be required from any incumbent organization previously designated by the board or elected and such incumbent organization shall be listed on the ballot if a petition for a representation election is filed. The petitioning organization, the incumbent organization, if any, and any intervening organization may agree on an impartial person or agency to conduct such an election consistent with the other provisions of this section, provided not more than one such election shall be held to elect an organization to represent the employees in such unit in any one school year, except, however, if no organization receives a majority of the vote validly cast, the election shall not be deemed completed and within ten days after the initial election a runoff election shall be held. In the event of a disagreement on the agency to conduct the election, the method shall be determined by the board of arbitration selected in accordance with section 10-153c. The person or agency so selected shall conduct, between twenty and forty-five days after the first petition requesting an election is filed with the commissioner, an election by secret ballot to determine which organization, if any, shall represent such unit, provided if no organization receives a majority of the vote validly cast, such election shall not be deemed completed and a runoff election between the two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the election shall be held within ten days after the initial election. The organizations participating in the election and the organizations participating in the runoff election shall share equally in the cost incurred by the impartial person or agency selected to conduct each election. Such person or agency shall immediately report the results of the election or runoff election to the commissioner. Within five days after receipt of the tally of ballots in the election or runoff election, any party to said election or runoff election may file with the commissioner any objection to said election or runoff election. If timely objections are found to be valid and they affected the results of the election or runoff election, the commissioner shall order another election or runoff election, as appropriate, to be conducted within ten days of the commissioner’s decision. If satisfied that the election or runoff election has been conducted properly, the commissioner shall certify that the organization receiving a majority of votes is the exclusive representative of the employees in such unit.

(e) The representative designated or elected in accordance with this section shall, from the date of such designation or election, be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of negotiating with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment, provided any certified professional employee or group of such employees shall have the right at any time to present any grievance to such persons as the local or regional board of education shall designate for that purpose. The terms of any existing contract shall not be abrogated by the election or designation of a new representative. During the balance of the term of such contract the board of education and the new representative shall have the duty to negotiate pursuant to section 10-153d concerning a successor agreement. The new representative shall, from the date of designation or election, acquire the rights and powers and shall assume the duties and obligations of the existing contract during the period of its effectiveness.

(f) Any organization which has been designated or elected the exclusive representative of a unit which includes teachers and administrators shall continue to be the exclusive representative of such personnel upon expiration of the salary agreement in effect between such organization and the board of education employing such personnel on July 1, 1969, until or unless employees of such board of education in either of the units defined in this section initiate a petition for designation or election of an organization to represent them in accordance with the procedures set forth in sections 10-153a to 10-153n, inclusive.

#### Section 10-153e: Prohibited practices of employers, employees and representatives. Hearing before State Board of Labor Relations. Appeal. Penalty.

(a) No certified professional employee shall, in an effort to effect a settlement of any disagreement with the employing board of education, engage in any strike or concerted refusal to render services. This provision may be enforced in the superior court for any judicial district in which said board of education is located by an injunction issued by said court or a judge thereof pursuant to sections 52-471 to 52-479, inclusive, provided the Commissioner of Education shall be given notice of any hearing and the commissioner or said commissioner’s designee shall be an interested party for the purposes of section 52-474.

(b) The local or regional board of education or its representatives or agents are prohibited from: (1) Interfering, restraining or coercing certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in sections 10-153a to 10-153n; (2) dominating or interfering with the formation, existence or administration of any employees’ bargaining agent or representative; (3) discharging or otherwise discriminating against or for any certified professional employee because such employee has signed or filed any affidavit, petition or complaint under said sections; (4) refusing to negotiate in good faith with the employees’ bargaining agent or representative which has been designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit in accordance with the provisions of said sections; or (5) refusing to participate in good faith in mediation or arbitration. A prohibited practice committed by a board of education, its representatives or agents shall not be a defense to an illegal strike or concerted refusal to render services.

(c) Any organization of certified professional employees or its agents is prohibited from: (1) Interfering, restraining or coercing (A) certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in this section and sections 10-153a to 10-153c, inclusive, provided that this shall not impair the right of an employees’ bargaining agent or representative to prescribe its own rules with respect to acquisition or retention of membership provided such rules are not discriminatory and (B) a board of education in the selection of its representatives or agents; (2) discriminating against or for any certified professional employee because such employee has signed or filed any affidavit, petition or complaint under said sections; (3) breaching its duty of fair representation pursuant to section 10-153a; (4) refusing to negotiate in good faith with the employing board of education, if such organization has been designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit; (5) refusing to participate in good faith in mediation or arbitration; or (6) soliciting or advocating support from public school students for activities of certified professional employees or organizations of such employees.

(d) As used in this section, sections 10-153a to 10-153c, inclusive, and section 10-153g, “to negotiate in good faith” is the performance of the mutual obligation of the board of education or its representatives or agents and the organization designated or elected as the exclusive representative for the appropriate unit to meet at reasonable times, including meetings appropriately related to the budget-making process, and to participate actively so as to indicate a present intention to reach agreement with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation shall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.

(e) Whenever a board of education or employees’ representative organization has reason to believe that a prohibited practice, as defined in subsection (b) or (c) of this section, has been or is being committed, or whenever a certified employee believes a breach of the duty of fair representation under subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section has occurred or is occurring, such board of education, representative organization or certified employee shall file a written complaint with the State Board of Labor Relations and shall mail a copy of such complaint to the party that is the subject of the complaint. Upon receipt of a properly filed complaint said board shall refer such complaint to the agent who shall, after investigation and within ninety days after the date of such referral, either (1) make a report to said board recommending dismissal of the complaint or (2) issue a written complaint charging prohibited practices. If no such report is made and no such written complaint is issued, the Board of Labor Relations in its discretion may proceed to a hearing upon the party’s original complaint of the violation of this chapter which shall in such case be treated for the purpose of this section as a complaint issued by the agent. Upon receiving a report from the agent recommending dismissal of a complaint, said Board of Labor Relations may issue an order dismissing the complaint or may order a further investigation or a hearing thereon. Upon receiving a complaint issued by the agent, the Board of Labor Relations shall set a time and place for the hearing. Any such complaint may be amended with the permission of said board. The party so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint within five days after the service of such complaint or within such other time as said board may limit. Such party shall have the right to appear in person or otherwise to defend against such complaint. In the discretion of said board any person may be allowed to intervene in such proceeding. In any hearing said board shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence prevailing in the courts. A stenographic or electronic record of the testimony shall be taken at all hearings of the Board of Labor Relations and a transcript thereof shall be filed with said board upon its request. Said board shall have the power to order the taking of further testimony and further argument. If, upon all the testimony, said board determines that the party complained of has engaged in or is engaging in any prohibited practice, it shall state its finding of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such party an order requiring it to cease and desist from such prohibited practice, and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section. Such order may further require such party to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which the order has been complied with. If upon all the testimony the Board of Labor Relations is of the opinion that the party named in the complaint has not engaged in or is not engaging in any such prohibited practice, then said board shall make its finding of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. Until a transcript of the record in a case has been filed in the Superior Court, as provided in subsection (g) of this section, said board may at any time, upon notice, modify or set aside in whole or in part any finding or order made or issued by it. Proceedings before said board shall be held with all possible expedition. Any party who wishes to have a transcript of the proceedings before the Board of Labor Relations shall apply therefor. The parties may agree on the sharing of the costs of the transcript but, in the absence of such agreement, the costs shall be paid by the requesting party.

(f) For the purpose of hearings pursuant to this section before the Board of Labor Relations said board shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations and to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the Superior Court, upon application by said board, shall have jurisdiction to order such person to appear before said board to produce evidence or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question, and any failure to obey such order may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, correspondence, documents or other evidence in obedience to the subpoena of the board, on the ground that the testimony or evidence required may tend to incriminate or subject such person to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which such individual is compelled, after claiming a privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying. Complaints, orders and other processes and papers of the Board of Labor Relations or the agent may be served personally, by registered or certified mail, by telegraph or by leaving a copy thereof at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served. The verified return of service shall be proof of such service. Witnesses summoned before said board or the agent shall be paid the same fees and mileage allowances that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the person taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of this state. All processes of any court to which an application or petition may be made under this chapter may be served in the judicial district wherein the person or persons required to be served reside or may be found.

(g) (1) The Board of Labor Relations may petition the superior court for the judicial district wherein the prohibited practice in question occurred or wherein any party charged with the prohibited practice resides or transacts business, or, if said court is not in session, any judge of said court, for the enforcement of an order and for appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order, and shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the entire record of the proceedings, including the pleadings and testimony upon which such order was made and the finding and orders of said board. In the event an appeal has not been filed pursuant to section 4-183, the board may file its petition in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, or, if said court is not in session, the board may petition any judge of said court. Within five days after filing such petition in the Superior Court, said board shall cause a notice of such petition to be sent by registered or certified mail to all parties or their representatives. The Superior Court, or, if said court is not in session, any judge of said court, shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the questions determined thereon, and shall have the power to grant such relief, including temporary relief, as it deems just and suitable and to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of said board. (2) No objection that has not been urged before the Board of Labor Relations shall be considered by the court, unless the failure to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of said board as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before said board, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before said board and to be made part of the transcript. The Board of Labor Relations may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. (3) The jurisdiction of the Superior Court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Appellate Court, on appeal, by either party, irrespective of the nature of the decree or judgment or the amount involved. Such appeal shall be taken and prosecuted in the same manner and form and with the same effect as is provided in other cases of appeal to the Appellate Court, and the record so certified shall contain all that was before the lower court. (4) Any party aggrieved by a final order of the Board of Labor Relations granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may appeal pursuant to the provisions of chapter 54 to the superior court for the judicial district where the prohibited practice was alleged to have occurred, in the judicial district of New Britain, or in the judicial district wherein such party resides or transacts business. (5) Petitions filed under this subsection shall be heard expeditiously and determined upon the transcript filed, without requirement of printing. Hearings in the Superior Court or Appellate Court under this chapter shall take precedence over all other matters, except matters of the same character.

(h) Subject to regulations to be made by the Board of Labor Relations, the complaints, orders and testimony relating to a proceeding instituted under subsection (e) of this section may be available for inspection or copying. All proceedings pursuant to said subsection shall be open to the public.

(i) Any person who wilfully resists, prevents or interferes with any member of the Board of Labor Relations or the agent in the performance of duties pursuant to subsections (e) to (i), inclusive, of this section shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.

Each member of the panel shall serve a term of two years, provided each arbitrator shall hold office until a successor is appointed and, provided further, any arbitrator not reappointed shall finish to conclusion any arbitration for which such arbitrator has been selected or appointed.

(b) If any local or regional board of education cannot agree with the exclusive representatives of a teachers’ or administrators’ unit after negotiation concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employees in such unit, either party may submit the issues to the commissioner for mediation. On the one hundred sixtieth day prior to the budget submission date, the commissioner shall order the parties to report their settlement. If, on such one hundred sixtieth day, the parties have not reached agreement and have failed to initiate mediation, the commissioner shall order the parties to notify the commissioner of the name of a mutually selected mediator and to commence mediation. The commissioner may order the parties to appear before said commissioner during the mediation period. In either case, the parties shall meet with a mediator mutually selected by them, provided such parties shall inform the commissioner of the name of such mediator, or with the commissioner or the commissioner’s agents or a mediator designated by said commissioner. Mediators shall be chosen from a panel of mediators selected by the State Board of Education or from outside such panel if mutually agreed by the parties. Such mediators shall receive a per diem fee determined on the basis of the prevailing rate for such services, and the parties shall share equally in the cost of such mediation. In any civil or criminal case, any proceeding preliminary thereto, or in any legislative or administrative proceeding, a mediator shall not disclose any confidential communication made to such mediator in the course of mediation unless the party making such communication waives such privilege. The parties shall provide such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may recommend a basis for settlement but such recommendations shall not be binding upon the parties. Such recommendation shall be made within twenty-five days after the day on which mediation begins.

(c) (1) On the fourth day next following the end of the mediation session or on the one hundred thirty-fifth day prior to the budget submission date, whichever is sooner, the commissioner shall order the parties to report their settlement of the dispute or, if there is no settlement, to notify the commissioner of either their agreement to submit their dispute to a single arbitrator or the name of the arbitrator selected by each of them. Within five days of providing such notice, the parties shall notify the commissioner of the name of the arbitrator if there is an agreement on a single arbitrator appointed to the panel pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section or agreement on the third arbitrator appointed to the panel pursuant to said subdivision. The commissioner may order the parties to appear before said commissioner during the arbitration period. If the parties have notified the commissioner of their agreement to submit their dispute to a single arbitrator and they have not agreed on such arbitrator, within five days after such notification, the commissioner shall select such single arbitrator who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. If each party has notified the commissioner of the name of the arbitrator it has selected and the parties have not agreed on the third arbitrator, within five days after such notification, the commissioner shall select a third arbitrator, who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. If either party fails to notify the commissioner of the name of an arbitrator, the commissioner shall select an arbitrator to serve and the commissioner shall also select a third arbitrator who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. Any selection pursuant to this section by the commissioner of an impartial arbitrator shall be made at random from among the members appointed under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. Arbitrators shall be selected from the panel appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and shall receive a per diem fee determined on the basis of the prevailing rate for such services. Whenever a panel of three arbitrators is selected, the chairperson of such panel shall be the impartial representative of the interests of the public in general.

(2) The chairperson of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator shall set the date, time and place for a hearing to be held in the school district between the fifth and twelfth day, inclusive, after such chairperson or such single arbitrator is selected. At least five days prior to such hearing, a written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be sent to the board of education and the representative organization which are parties to the dispute, and, if a three-member arbitration panel is selected or designated, to the other members of such panel. Such written notice shall also be sent, by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the fiscal authority having budgetary responsibility or charged with making appropriations for the school district, and a representative designated by such body may be heard at the hearing as part of the presentation and participation of the board of education. At the hearing each party shall have full opportunity to submit all relevant evidence, to introduce relevant documents and written material and to argue on behalf of its positions. At the hearing a representative of the fiscal authority having budgetary responsibility or charged with making appropriations for the school district shall be heard regarding the financial capability of the school district, unless such opportunity to be heard is waived by the fiscal authority. The nonappearance of the representative shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to be heard unless there is a showing that proper notice was not given to the fiscal authority. The chairperson of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator shall preside over such hearing.

(3) The hearing may, at the discretion of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator, be continued but in any event shall be concluded within twenty-five days after its commencement.

The written decision shall include a narrative explaining the evaluation by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator of the evidence presented for each item upon which a decision was rendered by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator and shall state with particularity the basis for the decision as to each disputed issue and the manner in which the factors enumerated in this subdivision were considered in arriving at such decision, including, where applicable, the specific similar groups and conditions of employment presented for comparison and accepted by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator and the reason for such acceptance. The arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall file one copy of the decision with the commissioner, each town clerk in the school district involved, the legislative body or bodies of the town or towns for the school district involved, or, in the case of a town for which the legislative body of the town is a town meeting or representative town meeting, to the board of selectmen, and the board of education and organization which are parties to the dispute. The decision of the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute unless a rejection is filed in accordance with subdivision (7) of this subsection. The decision of the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall incorporate those items of agreement the parties have reached prior to its issuance. At any time prior to the issuance of a decision by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator, the parties may jointly file with the arbitrators or the single arbitrator, any stipulations setting forth contract provisions which both parties agree to accept. In arriving at a decision, the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall give priority to the public interest and the financial capability of the town or towns in the school district, including consideration of other demands on the financial capability of the town or towns in the school district. In assessing the financial capability of the town or towns, there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that a budget reserve of five per cent or less is not available for payment of the cost of any item subject to arbitration under this chapter. The arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall further consider, in light of such financial capability, the following factors: (A) The negotiations between the parties prior to arbitration, including the offers and the range of discussion of the issues; (B) the interests and welfare of the employee group; (C) changes in the cost of living averaged over the preceding three years; (D) the existing conditions of employment of the employee group and those of similar groups; and (E) the salaries, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment prevailing in the state labor market, including the terms of recent contract settlements or awards in collective bargaining for other municipal employee organizations and developments in private sector wages and benefits. The parties shall submit to the arbitrators or the single arbitrator their respective positions on each individual issue in dispute between them in the form of a last best offer. The arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall resolve separately each individual disputed issue by accepting the last best offer thereon of either of the parties, and shall incorporate in a decision each such accepted individual last best offer and an explanation of how the total cost of all offers accepted was considered. The award of the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall not be subject to rejection by referendum. The parties shall each pay the fee of the arbitrator selected by or for them and share equally the fee of the third arbitrator or the single arbitrator and all other costs incidental to the arbitration.

(5) The commissioner shall assist the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator as may be required in the course of arbitration pursuant to this section.

(6) If the day for filing any document required pursuant to this section falls on Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, the time for such filing shall be extended to the next business day thereafter.

(7) The award of the arbitrators or single arbitrator may be rejected by the legislative body of the local school district or, in the case of a regional school district, by the legislative bodies of the participating towns. Such rejection shall be by a two-thirds majority vote of the members of such legislative body or, in the case of a regional school district, the legislative body of each participating town, present at a regular or special meeting called and convened for such purpose within twenty-five days of the receipt of the award. If the legislative body or legislative bodies, as appropriate, reject any such award, they shall notify, within ten days after the vote to reject, the commissioner and the exclusive representative for the teachers’ or administrators’ unit of such vote and submit to them a written explanation of the reasons for the vote. Within ten days after receipt of such notice, the exclusive representative of the teachers’ or administrators’ unit shall prepare, and the board of education may prepare, a written response to such rejection and shall submit it to such legislative body or legislative bodies, as appropriate, and the commissioner. Within ten days after the commissioner has been notified of the vote to reject, (A) the commissioner shall select a review panel of three arbitrators or, if the parties agree, a single arbitrator, who are residents of Connecticut and labor relations arbitrators approved by the American Arbitration Association and not members of the panel who issued the rejected award, and (B) such arbitrators or single arbitrator shall review the decision on each rejected issue. The review conducted pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the record and briefs of the hearing pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the written explanation of the reasons for the vote and a written response by either party. In conducting such review, the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall be limited to consideration of the criteria set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection. Such review shall be completed within twenty days of the appointment of the arbitrators or single arbitrator. The arbitrators or single arbitrator shall accept the last best offer of either of the parties. Within five days after the completion of such review, the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall render a final and binding award with respect to each rejected issue. The decision of the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include the specific reasons and standards used by each arbitrator in making his decision on each issue. The decision shall be filed with the parties. The reasonable costs of the arbitrators or single arbitrator and the cost of the transcript shall be paid by the legislative body or legislative bodies, as appropriate. Where the legislative body of the school district is the town meeting, the board of selectmen shall have all of the authority and responsibilities required of and granted to the legislative body under this subdivision.

(8) The decision of the arbitrators or a single arbitrator shall be subject to judicial review upon the filing by a party to the arbitration, within thirty days following receipt of a final decision pursuant to subdivision (4) or (7), as appropriate, of a motion to vacate or modify such decision in the superior court for the judicial district wherein the school district involved is located. The superior court, after hearing, may vacate or modify the decision if substantial rights of a party have been prejudiced because such decision is: (A) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (B) in excess of the statutory authority of the panel; (C) made upon unlawful procedure; (D) affected by other error of law; (E) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. In any action brought pursuant to this subdivision to vacate or modify the decision of the arbitrators or single arbitrator, reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and legal interest on salary withheld as the result of an appeal of said decision may be awarded in accordance with the following: Where the board of education moves to vacate or modify the decision and the decision is not vacated or modified, the court may award to the organization which is the exclusive representative reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and legal interest on salary withheld as the result of an appeal; or, where the organization which is the exclusive representative moves to vacate or modify the decision and the decision is not vacated or modified, the court may award to the board of education reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and legal interest on salary withheld as the result of an appeal.

(d) The commissioner and the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall have the same powers and duties as the board under section 31-108 for the purposes of mediation or arbitration pursuant to this section, and subsection (c) of section 10-153d, and all provisions in section 31-108 with respect to procedure, jurisdiction of the Superior Court, witnesses and penalties shall apply.

(e) The local or regional board of education and the organization designated or elected as the exclusive representative for the appropriate unit, through designated officials or their representatives, which are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and which, for the purpose of negotiating with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment, mutually agree to negotiate during the term of the agreement or are ordered to negotiate said agreement by a body of competent jurisdiction, shall notify the commissioner of the date upon which negotiations commenced within five days after said commencement. If the parties are unable to reach settlement twenty-five days after the date of the commencement of negotiations, the parties shall notify the commissioner of the name of a mutually selected mediator and shall conduct mediation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, notwithstanding the mediation time schedule of subsection (b) of this section. On the fourth day next following the end of the mediation session or on the fiftieth day following the date of the commencement of negotiations, whichever is sooner, if no settlement is reached the parties shall commence arbitration pursuant to the provisions of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section, notwithstanding the reference to the budget submission date.

(f) The State Board of Education shall adopt regulations pursuant to chapter 54 concerning the method by which names of persons who are impartial representatives of the interests of the public in general are placed on lists submitted by the State Board of Education to the Governor for appointment to the arbitration panel established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

Such arrangements may include the establishment of a committee to supervise such programs, the membership of the committee to be determined by the agreement of the cooperating boards. Such committee shall have the power, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, to (1) apply for, receive directly and expend on behalf of the school districts which have designated the committee an agent for such purpose any state or federal grants which may be allocated to school districts for specified programs, the supervision of which has been delegated to such committee, provided such grants are payable before implementation of any such program or are to reimburse the committee pursuant to subsection (d) of this section for transportation provided to a school operated by a cooperative arrangement; (2) receive and disburse funds appropriated to the use of such committee by the cooperating school districts, the state or the United States, or given to the committee by individuals or private corporations; (3) hold title to real or personal property in trust, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, for the appointing boards; (4) employ personnel; (5) enter into contracts; and (6) otherwise provide the specified programs, services and activities.

Upon dissolution of the committee, any property held in trust shall be distributed in accordance with the agreement, if such distribution is not contrary to law.

(c) If a cooperative arrangement receives a grant for a school building project pursuant to chapter 173, the cooperative arrangement shall use the building for which the grant was provided for a period of not less than twenty years after completion of such project. If the cooperative arrangement ceases to use the building for the purpose for which the grant was provided, the Commissioner of Education shall determine whether (1) title to the building and any legal interest in appurtenant land reverts to the state or (2) the cooperative arrangement reimburses the state an amount equal to ten per cent of the eligible school building project costs of the project.

(d) Any cooperative arrangement established pursuant to this section, or any local or regional board of education which is a member of such a cooperative arrangement which transports students to a school operated by such cooperative arrangement shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of section 10-266m. At the end of each school year, any such cooperative arrangement or local or regional board of education which provides such transportation shall file an application for reimbursement on a form provided by the Department of Education.

### Chapter 167a: TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT SYSTEM

#### Section 10-183b: Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

(1) “Actuarial reserve basis” means a basis under which the liabilities of the retirement system are determined under acceptable actuarial methods and under which assets are accumulated under a program designed to achieve a proper balance between the accumulated assets and the liabilities of the system.

(2) “Amortization of unfunded liabilities” means a systematic program of annual payments determined as a level per cent of expected member annual salaries in lieu of a lump sum payment.

(3) “Annual salary” means the annual salary rate for service as a Connecticut teacher during a school year but not including unused sick leave, unused vacation, terminal pay, coaching or extra duty assignments, unless compensation for coaching or extra duty assignment was included in salary for which contributions were made prior to July 1, 1971. In no event shall annual salary include amounts determined by the board to be included for the purpose of inflating the member’s average annual salary. The inclusion in annual salary of amounts paid to the member, in lieu of payment by the employer for the cost of benefits, insurance, or individual retirement arrangements which in prior years had been paid by the employer and not included in the member’s annual salary, shall be prima facie evidence that such amounts are included for the purpose of inflating the member’s average annual salary. Annual salary shall not (A) include payments the timing of which may be directed by the member, (B) include payments to a superintendent pursuant to an individual contract between such superintendent and a board of education, of amounts which are not included in base salary, or (C) exceed the maximum amount allowed under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code for the applicable limitation year, provided in no event shall the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code apply to the annual salary of a member whose membership began prior to January 1, 1996, if such limitation would reduce the amount of the member’s annual salary below the amount permitted for calculation of the member’s retirement benefit under chapter 167a, without regard to the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Annual salary shall include amounts paid to the member during a sabbatical leave during which mandatory contributions were remitted, provided such member returned to full-time teaching for at least five full years following the completion of such leave.

(4) “Average annual salary” means the average annual salary received during the three years of highest salary.

(5) “Board” means the Teachers’ Retirement Board.

(6) “Child” means a natural child, an adopted child, or a stepchild of a deceased member who has been a stepchild for at least one year immediately prior to the date on which the member died. A child is a “dependent child” of a deceased member if at the time of the member’s death (A) the member was living with the child or providing or obligated to provide, by agreement or court order, a reasonable portion of the support of the child, and (B) the child (i) is unmarried and has not attained age eighteen, or (ii) is disabled and such disability began prior to the child’s attaining age eighteen.

(7) “Contributions” means amounts withheld pursuant to this chapter and paid to the board by an employer from compensation payable to a member. Prior to July 1, 1989, “mandatory contributions” are contributions required to be withheld under this chapter and consist of five per cent regular contributions and “one per cent contributions”. From July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1992, “mandatory contributions” are contributions required to be withheld under this chapter and consist of five per cent regular contributions and one per cent health contributions. From July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2004, “mandatory contributions” are contributions required to be withheld under this chapter and consist of six per cent “regular contributions” and one per cent health contributions. On or after July 1, 2004, “mandatory contributions” are contributions required to be withheld under this chapter and consist of six per cent regular contributions and one and one-fourth per cent health contributions. “Voluntary contributions” are contributions by a member authorized to be withheld under section 10-183i.

(8) “Credited interest” means interest at the rate from time to time fixed by the board consistent with industry standards and practices. Such interest shall be applied to a member’s account based on the balance as of the previous June thirtieth. Credited interest shall be assessed on any mandatory contributions which were due but not remitted prior to the close of the school year for which salary was paid.

(9) “Current service” means service rendered in the current fiscal year.

(10) “Dependent former spouse” means a former spouse of a deceased member who (A) has in his or her care a dependent child of the deceased member; and (B) was receiving, or was entitled to receive, from the deceased member at the time of the death of the deceased member, at least one-half of his or her support; and (C) has not remarried; and (D) is the parent of the child or adopted the child while married to the member and before the child attained age eighteen or, while married to the member, both of them adopted the child before the child attained age eighteen.

(11) “Dependent parent” means a parent of a deceased member who (A) has reached the age of sixty-five; and (B) has not married after the death of the member; and (C) was receiving at least one-half of his or her support from the member at the time of the member’s death and files proof of such support within two years of the date of the member’s death; and (D) is not receiving, or entitled to a federal or state old age benefit based on the parent’s own earnings, equal to or greater than the amount the parent would be entitled to as a dependent parent under this chapter. A “parent of a deceased member” is (i) the mother or father of a deceased member; or (ii) a stepparent of a deceased member by a marriage entered into before the member attained age sixteen; or (iii) an adopting parent of a deceased member who adopted the deceased member before the member attained age sixteen.

(13) “Disabled” means inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration, except that during the first twenty-four months that a member is receiving a disability allowance, “disabled” means the inability to perform the usual duties of his occupation by reason of any such impairment.

(17) “Funding” means the accumulation of assets in advance of the payment of retirement allowances in accordance with a definite actuarial program.

(18) “Member” means any Connecticut teacher employed for an average of at least one-half of each school day, except that no teacher who under any provision of the general statutes elects not to participate in the system shall be a member unless and until the teacher elects to participate in the system. Members teaching in a nonpublic school classified as a public school by the board under the provisions of this section may continue as members as long as they continue as teachers in such school even if the school ceases to be so classified. A former teacher who has not withdrawn his or her accumulated contributions shall be an “inactive member”.

#### Section 10-183g: Benefit rates. Commencing and ending dates.

(a) Normal retirement. The normal retirement benefit shall be two per cent times the number of years of full-time credited service and a proportional fraction of two per cent times the number of years of credited service at less than full-time multiplied by average annual salary. In no event, however, shall such benefit exceed seventy-five per cent of such salary or be less than three thousand six hundred dollars.

(b) Proratable retirement. The proratable retirement benefit shall be computed as follows: Average annual salary multiplied by (1) number of years of credited service, excluding all additional credited service, except service described in subdivisions (3), (8) and (10) of subsection (b) of section 10-183e, multiplied by the applicable percentage based on age and service as determined from the table below, and (2) number of years of all additional credited service not used in subdivision (1) of this subsection multiplied by one per cent.

#### Section 10-183h: Death benefits.

(a) Survivors’ benefits; waiver. The basic survivor’s monthly benefit, subject to a family maximum of one thousand five hundred dollars, shall be (1) three hundred dollars each for a surviving spouse, plus twenty-five dollars for each year of service in excess of twelve years in the Connecticut public schools completed by the member, subject to a maximum monthly benefit of six hundred dollars, (2) three hundred dollars each for a dependent former spouse; for a dependent parent if there is no surviving spouse or dependent child; and for a legal guardian of any dependent child if there is no surviving spouse, dependent former spouse or dependent parent, and (3) three hundred dollars for each dependent child. In applying the family maximum, the benefit shall be first allocated to the child or children, with the excess allocated to the surviving spouse and any dependent former spouse in proportion to the amount each would receive according to the above formula. Payment of the benefit shall commence on the last day of the month following the month of the member’s death. Such benefit shall continue through the month preceding the month in which the survivor dies or ceases to be eligible for such benefit. Such benefit to the legal guardian of dependent children shall continue until all such children are no longer dependent, as defined in section 10-183b. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any such surviving spouse, dependent former spouse, dependent parent or legal guardian may waive the right to payment of the benefit under this subsection in order that a designated beneficiary who is the child of the deceased member may receive such member’s accumulated contributions plus credited interest. Such waiver shall be made prior to the payment of the benefit to any such surviving spouse, dependent former spouse, dependent parent or legal guardian.

(b) Lump sum death benefits. If no coparticipant option under 10-183j has become effective, a lump sum death benefit shall be payable to the surviving spouse. Such benefit shall be one thousand dollars for five years or less of Connecticut public school service, plus two hundred dollars for each year of credited service in excess of five years, to a maximum of two thousand dollars. For purposes of this subsection, purchased military service and purchased leaves of absence under subdivisions (3) and (8) of subsection (b) of section 10-183e shall be deemed to be Connecticut public school service. If there is no surviving spouse, such benefit shall be equal to the member’s burial expenses but not in excess of what would have been payable to a surviving spouse and shall be payable to the person who paid such expenses. No payment under this subsection shall be made unless application for the payment is filed with the board within two years of such member’s death.

(c) Return of accumulated contributions to sole survivor. In lieu of such basic survivor’s benefit and such lump sum benefit, a sole survivor who has attained age eighteen, and is the member’s designated beneficiary may elect to receive an amount equal to such member’s accumulated contributions together with credited interest. When a member has designated two or more beneficiaries, who have, at the time of such member’s death, attained age eighteen, the one entitled to basic survivor’s benefits, if any, shall be deemed the sole survivor within the meaning of this subsection, provided, that all other designated beneficiaries relinquish all claim to any amounts that may be due them from the system.

(d) Surviving spouse’s benefit. The surviving spouse of any member who, at the time of death was eligible for a retirement benefit other than a disability benefit and had not filed a waiver of the coparticipant’s option, may elect to receive (1) a monthly benefit for life equal to the benefit payable if a one hundred per cent coparticipant’s option had been elected or (2) an amount equal to the member’s accumulated contributions with credited interest.

(e) Benefit payable when contributions exceed payments. If no coparticipant option has become effective and if the aggregate payments under this section are less than the accumulated mandatory contributions of a deceased member plus credited interest, there shall be paid to such member’s designated beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between such aggregate payments and such accumulated mandatory contributions plus credited interest.

(f) Continuation of benefit upon remarriage. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B) of subdivision (23) of section 10-183b, benefits payable under this section to a surviving spouse shall not be terminated because of remarriage if such surviving spouse has attained the age of sixty.

(g) Spouse’s options when member dies after filing retirement application but before effective date of retirement. If a member who has filed an application for retirement dies prior to the effective date of retirement, such member’s spouse, if such spouse is designated on such application as the sole beneficiary, may elect to receive either (1) the preretirement death benefits as set forth in this section, or (2) the benefit payment option selected by the deceased member on such retirement application.

#### Section 10-183i: Member’s voluntary contributions. Limitations.

(a) A member may make voluntary contributions to the system and may, no more than once, withdraw such voluntary contributions from the system under rules of the board. Voluntary contributions shall be subject to the limitations imposed under Section 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code for the applicable limitation year. Such contributions shall earn credited interest. Upon retirement such member shall elect to receive the accumulated contributions plus credited interest either in a lump sum or in the form of an actuarially equivalent annuity for life. Such lump sum or annuity shall be paid or commenced to be paid when the first payment of such member’s other retirement benefit is made. If such member dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, the accumulated contributions plus credited interest shall be paid to such member’s designated beneficiary.

(b) A period certain option may be elected in which the member receives an actuarially reduced benefit for a fixed period of time selected by such member and for the remainder of such member’s life. Such member may select a fixed period of twenty-five years or such shorter period as the board may offer. If such member dies before receiving the benefit for the selected period, such benefit shall be paid to the member’s designated beneficiary for the remainder of such period.

(c) A coparticipant’s option may be elected in which the member receives an actuarially reduced benefit as provided in subsection (d) of this section and upon such member’s death, one-third, one-half, two-thirds, three-fourths or all of such amount is paid to such member’s designated beneficiary for life. With respect to any benefits which become effective on or after January 1, 2001, if twenty-five per cent of the aggregate benefits paid to the member or such member’s designated beneficiary are, upon the death of such member or such designated beneficiary, less than such member’s accumulated contributions plus credited interest, the estate of such member or such designated beneficiary, as appropriate, shall be paid a lump sum amount equal to the difference between such aggregate benefits paid and such accumulated contributions plus credited interest.

(d) The benefits payable to such member and such coparticipant shall be computed as follows:

(1) The benefit payable to such member at retirement and to such coparticipant upon such member’s death shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal, early, proratable or disability benefit for which such member is eligible and based upon such member’s age at retirement and the age of such coparticipant on such retirement date.

(2) The benefit payable to such coparticipant of such member who dies after such option first becomes effective but before retirement shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal, early or proratable benefit for which such member was eligible based on such member’s age at death and the age of such coparticipant on such date of death.

(3) The benefit payable to a member whose designated coparticipant dies or is divorced from the member after the effective date of the option but before the retirement or death of such member shall be the normal, early, proratable or disability benefit for which the member is eligible. A coparticipant option shall be terminated, for any member whose designated coparticipant dies or is divorced from the member after the member’s retirement, on the date of such death or divorce. Such member shall thereupon be paid the normal, early, proratable or disability benefit for which the member is eligible.

If such member does not elect a refund, but dies before age sixty or before receiving the deferred vested benefit, if later, such member’s accumulated voluntary contributions, accumulated regular contributions and accumulated one per cent contributions withheld prior to July 1, 1989, together with credited interest shall be paid to such member’s designated beneficiary.

(d) A member who receives a refund and returns to service shall be regarded as a new member unless such member repays the amount refunded, other than voluntary contributions and the interest thereon, together with credited interest compounded from the date interest was last credited to such member’s account to the date of repayment. The credited service accumulated before termination and any unrefunded one per cent contributions withheld prior to July 1, 1989, and credited interest shall be restored to a member who makes such repayment. Restored contributions and interest shall be credited with credited interest for the period between the last day for which interest was credited on such contributions and such member’s return to service.

#### Section 10-183t: Health insurance: Plans maintained by Teachers’ Retirement Board and boards of education; state payment of premiums on behalf of members; use of one per cent voluntary contributions.

(a) The retirement board shall offer one or more health benefit plans to: Any member receiving retirement benefits or a disability allowance from the system; the spouse or surviving spouse of such member, and a disabled dependent of such member if there is no spouse or surviving spouse, provided such member, spouse, surviving spouse, or disabled dependent is participating in Medicare Part A hospital insurance and Medicare Part B medical insurance. The board may offer one or more basic plans, the cost of which to any such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall be one-third of the basic plan’s premium equivalent, and one or more optional plans, provided such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall pay one-third of the basic plan’s premium equivalent plus the difference in cost between any such basic plans and any such optional plans. The board shall designate those plans which are basic and those plans which are optional for the purpose of determining such cost and the amount to be charged or withheld from benefit payments for such plans. The surviving spouse of a member, or a disabled dependent of a member if there is no surviving spouse, shall not be ineligible for participation in any such plan solely because such surviving spouse or disabled dependent is not receiving benefits from the system. With respect to any person participating in any such plan, the state shall appropriate to the board one-third of the cost of such basic plan or plans, or one-third of the cost of the rate in effect during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, whichever is greater. On and after July 1, 2012, federal reimbursements received by the retirement board under the retiree drug subsidy provisions of Medicare Part D shall be used to offset amounts appropriated by the state to the board pursuant to this subsection.

(b) Any member who is receiving retirement benefits or a disability allowance from the system, the spouse or surviving spouse of such member, or a disabled dependent of such member if there is no spouse or surviving spouse, and who is not participating in Medicare Part A hospital insurance and Medicare Part B medical insurance, may fully participate in any or all group health insurance plans maintained for active teachers by such member’s last employing board of education, or by the state in the case of a member who was employed by the state, upon payment to such board of education or to the state, as applicable, by such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent, of the premium charged for his form of coverage. Such premium shall be no greater than that charged for the same form of coverage for active teachers. The spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall not be ineligible for participation in any such plan solely because such spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent is not receiving benefits from the system. No person shall be ineligible for participation in such plans for failure to enroll in such plans at the time the member’s retirement benefit or disability allowance became effective. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or alter the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement relating to the payment by a board of education of group health insurance premiums on behalf of any member receiving benefits from the system. Prior to the cancellation of coverage for any member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent for failure to pay the required premiums or cost due, the board of education or the state, if applicable, shall notify the Teachers’ Retirement Board of its intention to cancel such coverage at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Absent any contractual provisions to the contrary, the payments made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be first applied to any cost borne by the member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent participating in any such plan. As used in this subsection, “last employing board of education” means the board of education by which such member was employed when such member filed his initial application for retirement, and “health insurance plans” means hospital, medical, major medical, dental, prescription drug or auditory benefit plans that are available to active teachers.

(c) On and after July 1, 2000, the board shall pay a subsidy equal to the subsidy paid in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, to the board of education or to the state, if applicable, on behalf of any member who is receiving retirement benefits or a disability allowance from the system, the spouse of such member, the surviving spouse of such member, or a disabled dependent of such member if there is no spouse or surviving spouse, who is participating in a health insurance plan maintained by a board of education or by the state, if applicable. Such payment shall not exceed the actual cost of such insurance. With respect to any person participating in any such plan pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the state shall appropriate to the board one-third of the cost of the subsidy, except that, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the state shall appropriate twenty-five per cent of the cost of the subsidy. No payment to a board of education pursuant to this subsection may be used to reduce the amount of any premium payment on behalf of any such member, spouse, surviving spouse, or disabled dependent, made by such board pursuant to any agreement in effect on July 1, 1990. On and after July 1, 2012, the board shall pay a subsidy of two hundred twenty dollars per month on behalf of the member, spouse or the surviving spouse of such member who: (1) Has attained the normal retirement age to participate in Medicare, (2) is not eligible for Medicare Part A without cost, and (3) contributes at least two hundred twenty dollars per month towards his or her medical and prescription drug plan provided by the board of education.

(d) The Treasurer shall establish a separate retired teachers’ health insurance premium account within the Teachers’ Retirement Fund. Commencing July 1, 1989, and annually thereafter all health benefit plan contributions withheld under this chapter in excess of five hundred thousand dollars shall, upon deposit in the Teachers’ Retirement Fund, be credited to such account. Interest derived from the investment of funds in the account shall be credited to the account. Funds in the account shall be used for (1) payments to boards of education pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and for payment of premiums on behalf of members, spouses of members, surviving spouses of members or disabled dependents of members participating in one or more health insurance plans pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and the amount paid pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (2) payments for professional fees associated with the administration of the health benefit plans offered pursuant to this section of not more than one hundred fifty thousand dollars annually. If, during any fiscal year, there are insufficient funds in the account for the purposes of all such payments, the General Assembly shall appropriate sufficient funds to the account for such purpose.

#### Section 10-183z: Funding of system on actuarial reserve basis. Use of funds.

(a) The retirement system for teachers shall be funded on an actuarial reserve basis. The retirement board shall, on or before December first, annually, certify to the General Assembly the amount necessary, on the basis of an actuarial determination to establish and maintain the retirement fund on such determined actuarial reserve basis and make such other recommendations with regard to the fund and its administration as the board deems necessary. On the basis of each evaluation, the retirement board shall redetermine the normal rate of contribution and, until it is amortized, the unfunded past service liability. The General Assembly shall review the board’s recommendations and certification and shall appropriate to the retirement fund the amount certified by the retirement board as necessary provided said certification is in compliance with this section.

(b) The board shall determine on an actuarial basis (1) a normal rate of contribution which the state shall be required to make into the retirement fund in order to meet the actuarial cost of current service and (2) the unfunded past service liability. In making such determination the board shall assume that the annual rate of interest earned by the funds of the system invested by the State Treasurer pursuant to section 10-183m equals the total assumed rate of return adopted by the board under the provisions of section 10-183nn. For the first eight years, the funding program for the actuarial reserve basis shall consist of the following percentages of the sum of normal cost and the amount required for a forty-year amortization of unfunded liabilities, provided, if in any such year the amount required to be paid by this section is less than the amount which would be required to fund the system on a terminal basis and to pay the annual cost of benefits payable under subsection (j) of section 10-183g or under other prior legislative adjustments to retirement benefits, the state shall pay the greater amount:

#### Section 10-183aa: Disability allowance.

(a) An active member is eligible for a disability allowance if he or she has (1) become disabled as a result of any sickness or injury incurred in the performance of his or her duty as a teacher, without regard to the member’s accumulated years of service at the time the disability is incurred; or (2) accumulated at least five years of service in the public schools and becomes disabled, without regard to whether the disability was incurred in the performance of his or her duty as a teacher.

(b) The disability allowance is computed as follows: Two per cent times credited service to the date of disability multiplied by average annual salary, provided such allowance shall not be less than fifteen per cent or more than fifty per cent of the member’s average annual salary. In no case shall such disability allowance, less cost of living adjustments, plus any initial award of Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation, exceed seventy-five per cent of the member’s average annual salary.

(c) The board shall designate a medical committee to be composed of no more than five physicians. If required, other physicians may be employed to report on special cases. Such medical committee shall review each application for a disability allowance and shall make findings and recommendations in writing to the board. The medical committee shall perform additional examinations or case reviews as deemed necessary by the board. Members of such committee shall receive compensation for their services at a rate to be determined by the board.

(d) The disability allowance being paid to a member shall cease when and if the disability ends. The board may determine that a member’s disability has ended if it finds, upon the recommendation of its medical committee, that the member has failed to pursue an appropriate program of treatment. In either event, such member shall receive credited service for the years he received such disability allowance subject to a maximum total credit of thirty years, or actual years of credited service to the date the disability commenced, whichever is greater. Such member, if eligible, may then (1) retire on a normal, early or proratable retirement benefit or (2) retain a vested right to a deferred normal, early or proratable retirement benefit. Upon attainment of the member’s normal retirement date, as determined by his age and credited service, including the credited service granted by this subsection, the member’s disability allowance shall convert to a normal or other service retirement, which shall be payable either in the normal form or under an optional payment form under section 10-183j. The board may require periodic medical examinations.

(e) No credit for a period of service of any kind prior to the months in which contribution therefor is made shall be given under this chapter or any special act in determining service in connection with an application for disability allowance other than for injury received in performance of duty as a teacher if such disability occurred within five years after contributions and required interest on account of such period were paid in full. The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (1) any reinstatement of prior Connecticut teaching service, or (2) credit obtained immediately after transfer from the state employees retirement system under this chapter for service previously credited in said system; but in the case of such transfer, no allowance on account of disability occurring within such five-year period, other than for injury received in performance of duty as a teacher, shall exceed the benefit which would have been payable by said system if transfer had not been made.

(f) During the first twenty-four months of payment of the disability allowance to a member, twenty per cent of all of such member’s outside earned income or wages shall be offset against the disability allowance payable, unless the board determines that such earned income or wages are being paid as part of the rehabilitation of the member. At the expiration of such twenty-four-month period, if the total of the disability allowance and outside earned income exceeds one hundred per cent of average annual salary, the disability allowance will be reduced by the amount of such excess over one hundred per cent. The board shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning procedures for verification of the income of members in receipt of a disability allowance.

(g) All members of the teachers’ retirement system who are receiving disability payments under subsection (e) of section 10-183g of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1979, may, using a form provided by the board, elect to have their disability payments recomputed with regard to the percentage basis and pursuant to the provisions of this section and section 10-183bb. Such election shall not be revocable.

(b) If a member or beneficiary has been overpaid through no fault of his own, and he could not reasonably have been expected to detect the error, the board may waive any repayment which it believes would cause hardship.

(c) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, all provisions of section 3-20 or the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section are hereby adopted and shall apply to all bonds authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to this section, and temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of any such bonds so authorized may be issued in accordance with said section 3-20 and from time to time renewed. Such bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their respective dates as may be provided in or pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the State Bond Commission authorizing such bonds.

(d) None of said bonds shall be authorized except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it (1) a request for such authorization, which is signed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management or on behalf of such state officer and stating such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require, and (2) a written determination by the State Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management that the issuance of the bonds is in the best interests of the state.

Any net premium realized from the sale of said bonds shall be deemed appropriated to the payment of debt service on any bonds issued under this section and section 10-183c, subsection (l) of section 10-183g, section 10-183r and sections 12 and 13 of public act 07-186\*, and the State Treasurer may apply such net premium to payment of such debt service.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of section 3-21 to the contrary, bonds authorized and bonds issued under this section and any refunding bonds shall not be subject to the debt limitation in section 3-21 and shall not be included in indebtedness of the state for purposes of calculating the amount of indebtedness of the state which is subject to the debt limitation of section 3-21 and this section and action of the State Bond Commission shall not require any certification of the State Treasurer under section 3-21.

(h) Each fiscal year that any bonds authorized by this section or any refunding bonds are outstanding, there shall be deemed appropriated from the General Fund of the state the amount equal to the annual required contribution to the fund for the Connecticut teachers’ retirement system and such amount shall be deposited by the Treasurer in the fund for the Connecticut teachers’ retirement system in quarterly allotments on July fifteenth, October first, January first and April first of such fiscal year. The amount of the annual required contribution shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 10-183l and section 10-183z, and for each biennial budget shall be the amounts for the fiscal years of said biennium determined in the actuarial evaluation required to be submitted by the December first prior to the beginning of the first fiscal year of the biennium, as provided in said subsection (b) of section 10-183l, beginning with the actuarial evaluation submitted prior to December 1, 2006, for the biennial budget for the fiscal years commencing July 1, 2007, and July 1, 2008. Said amount shall be certified by the Teachers’ Retirement Board and the Comptroller. The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds issued under this section and any refunding bonds that, as long as the actuarial evaluation for each biennium, as required by this subsection, and the certification of the annual contribution amounts, as required by this subsection, are completed in the manner and by the dates required by this subsection, subsection (b) of section 10-183l and subsection (a) of section 10-183z, no public or special act of the General Assembly shall diminish such required contribution until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged, provided nothing herein contained shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, or if and when the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to diminish such required contribution during the biennium for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, and the funded ratio of the Connecticut teachers’ retirement system is at least equal to the funded ratio immediately after the sale of bonds pursuant to this section in accordance with the actuarial method used at the time. If all of such conditions are met, the funding of the annual required contribution may be diminished, but in no event shall such diminution result in a reduction of the funded ratio of the Connecticut teachers’ retirement system by more than five per cent from the funded ratio which would otherwise have resulted had the state funded the full annual required contribution, or the funded ratio immediately after the sale of the bonds, whichever is greater. For purposes of this subsection, the “funded ratio” shall be measured as the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities. The actuarial value of assets and the actuarial value of liabilities will be projected from the most recent actuarial valuation to the end of the fiscal year in which said annual required contribution is due. For purposes of this subsection, the “existence of extraordinary circumstances” may mean a change in the actuarial methods or accounting standards used to value the fund that would result in a significant increase in the state’s annual required contribution. The State Treasurer is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the state in such bonds.

#### Section 10-186: Duties of local and regional boards of education re school attendance. Hearings. Appeals to state board. Establishment of hearing board. Readmission. Transfers.

(a) Each local or regional board of education shall furnish, by transportation or otherwise, school accommodations so that each child five years of age and over and under twenty-one years of age who is not a graduate of a high school or technical high school may attend public school, except as provided in section 10-233c and subsection (d) of section 10-233d. Any board of education which denies school accommodations, including a denial based on an issue of residency, to any such child shall inform the parent or guardian of such child or the child, in the case of an emancipated minor or a pupil eighteen years of age or older, of his right to request a hearing by the board of education in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section. A board of education which has denied school accommodations shall advise the board of education under whose jurisdiction it claims such child should be attending school of the denial. For purposes of this section, (1) a “parent or guardian” shall include a surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, and (2) a child residing in a dwelling located in more than one town in this state shall be considered a resident of each town in which the dwelling is located and may attend school in any one of such towns. For purposes of this subsection, “dwelling” means a single, two or three-family house or a condominium unit.

(b) (1) If any board of education denies such accommodations, the parent or guardian of any child who is denied schooling, or an emancipated minor or a pupil eighteen years of age or older who is denied schooling, or an agent or officer charged with the enforcement of the laws concerning attendance at school, may, in writing, request a hearing by the board of education. The board of education may (A) conduct the hearing, (B) designate a subcommittee of the board composed of three board members to conduct the hearing, or (C) establish a local impartial hearing board of one or more persons not members of the board of education to conduct the hearing. The board, subcommittee or local impartial hearing board shall give such person a hearing within ten days after receipt of the written request, make a stenographic record or tape recording of the hearing and make a finding within ten days after the hearing. Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a. Any child, emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older who is denied accommodations on the basis of residency may continue in attendance in the school district at the request of the parent or guardian of such child or emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older, pending a hearing pursuant to this subdivision. The party claiming ineligibility for school accommodations shall have the burden of proving such ineligibility by a preponderance of the evidence, except in cases of denial of schooling based on residency, the party denied schooling shall have the burden of proving residency by a preponderance of the evidence.

(2) Any such parent, guardian, emancipated minor, pupil eighteen years of age or older, or agent or officer, aggrieved by the finding shall, upon request, be provided with a transcript of the hearing within thirty days after such request and may take an appeal from the finding to the State Board of Education. A copy of each notice of appeal shall be filed simultaneously with the local or regional board of education and the State Board of Education. Any child, emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older who is denied accommodations by a board of education as the result of a determination by such board, or a subcommittee of the board or local impartial hearing board, that the child is not a resident of the school district and therefore is not entitled to school accommodations in the district may continue in attendance in the school district at the request of the parent or guardian of such child or such minor or pupil, pending a determination of such appeal. If an appeal is not taken to the State Board of Education within twenty days of the mailing of the finding to the aggrieved party, the decision of the board, subcommittee or local impartial hearing board shall be final. The local or regional board of education shall, within ten days after receipt of notice of an appeal, forward the record of the hearing to the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall, on receipt of a written request for a hearing made in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, establish an impartial hearing board of one or more persons to hold a public hearing in the local or regional school district in which the cause of the complaint arises. Members of the hearing board may be employees of the Department of Education or may be qualified persons from outside the department. No member of the board of education under review nor any employee of such board of education shall be a member of the hearing board. Members of the hearing board, other than those employed by the Department of Education, shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as established by the State Board of Education within the limits of available appropriations. Such hearing board may examine witnesses and shall maintain a verbatim record of all formal sessions of the hearing. Either party to the hearing may request that the hearing board join all interested parties to the hearing, or the hearing board may join any interested party on its own motion. The hearing board shall have no authority to make a determination of the rights and responsibilities of a board of education if such board is not a party to the hearing. The hearing board may render a determination of actual residence of any child, emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older where residency is at issue.

(3) The hearing board shall render its decision within forty-five days after receipt of the notice of appeal except that an extension may be granted by the Commissioner of Education upon an application by a party or the hearing board describing circumstances related to the hearing which require an extension.

(4) If, after the hearing, the hearing board finds that any child is illegally or unreasonably denied schooling, the hearing board shall order the board of education under whose jurisdiction it has been found such child should be attending school to make arrangements to enable the child to attend public school. Except in the case of a residency determination, the finding of the local or regional board of education, subcommittee of such board or a local impartial hearing board shall be upheld unless it is determined by the hearing board that the finding was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. If such school officers fail to take action upon such order in any case in which such child is currently denied schooling and no suitable provision is made for such child within fifteen days after receipt of the order and in all other cases, within thirty days after receipt of the order, there shall be a forfeiture of the money appropriated by the state for the support of schools amounting to fifty dollars for each child for each day such child is denied schooling. If the hearing board makes a determination that the child was not a resident of the school district and therefore not entitled to school accommodations from such district, the board of education may assess tuition against the parent or guardian of the child or the emancipated minor or pupil eighteen years of age or older based on the following: One one-hundred-eightieth of the town’s net current local educational expenditure, as defined in section 10-261, per pupil multiplied by the number of days of school attendance of the child in the district while not entitled to school accommodations provided by that district. The local board of education may seek to recover the amount of the assessment through available civil remedies.

(c) In the event of an appeal pursuant to section 10-187 from a decision of a hearing board established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, upon request, the State Board of Education shall supply for the fee per page specified in section 1-212, a copy of the transcript of the formal sessions of the hearing board to the parent or guardian or emancipated minor or a pupil eighteen years of age or older and to the local or regional board of education.

(d) (1) For the school year commencing July 1, 2010, if a child sixteen years of age or older voluntarily terminates enrollment in a school district and subsequently seeks readmission, the local or regional board of education for the school district may deny school accommodations to such child for up to ninety school days from the date of such termination, unless such child seeks readmission to such school district not later than ten school days after such termination in which case such board shall provide school accommodations to such child not later than three school days after such child seeks readmission.

(2) For the school year commencing July 1, 2011, and each school year thereafter, if a child seventeen years of age or older voluntarily terminates enrollment in a school district and subsequently seeks readmission, the local or regional board of education for the school district may deny school accommodations to such child for up to ninety school days from the date of such termination, unless such child seeks readmission to such school district not later than ten school days after such termination in which case such board shall provide school accommodations to such child not later than three school days after such child seeks readmission.

The board shall not grant such authority to the commissioner unless the board has required the local or regional board of education to complete the training described in subparagraph (M) of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section. Upon such authorization by the board, the commissioner shall terminate the existing local or regional board of education and appoint the members of a new local or regional board of education for the school district. Upon the termination of an existing local or regional board of education, the electoral process for such board shall be suspended during the period of reconstitution. Such appointed members may include members of the board of education that was terminated. The terms of the members of the new board of education shall be three years. The Department of Education shall offer training to the members of the new board of education. The new board of education shall annually report to the commissioner regarding the district’s progress toward meeting the benchmarks established by the State Board of Education pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and making adequate yearly progress, as defined in the state accountability plan prepared in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section. Not later than one hundred eighty days before the conclusion of the three-year term of the reconstituted board of education, the commissioner may reappoint the members of the new board of education or appoint new members to such board of education for terms of two years, to commence at the conclusion of the initial three-year term, if the district fails to show adequate improvement, as determined by the State Board of Education, after three years.

(2) Upon terminating an existing local or regional board of education pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the town clerk in the school district, or in the case of a regional board of education, the town clerk of each member town, and the office of the Secretary of the State of such termination. Such notice shall include the date of such termination and the positions terminated.

(3) Not later than one hundred seventy-five days before the conclusion of the term of the reconstituted board of education, the commissioner shall notify the town clerk in the school district, or in the case of a regional board of education, the town clerk of each member town, and the office of the Secretary of the State of the date that such period of reconstitution will conclude. Upon receipt of such notice by the Secretary of the State, the electoral process shall commence in accordance with the provisions of section 9-164, except that if such notice is delivered before the time specified in section 9-391 to nominate candidates for municipal office in the year of a municipal election, such offices may be placed on the ballot of a regular election, as defined in section 9-1, with the approval of the legislative body of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 146 and section 10-46, the legislative body of the municipality or municipalities involved shall determine the terms of office of the new members to be elected for such office.

(4) For purposes of this subsection, “electoral process” includes, but is not limited to, the nominations of candidates by political parties, nominating petitions, write-in candidacies and the filling of vacancies on the board of education.

#### Section 10-233c: Suspension of pupils.

(a) Any local or regional board of education may authorize the administration of the schools under its direction to suspend from school privileges any pupil whose conduct on school grounds or at a school sponsored activity is violative of a publicized policy of such board or is seriously disruptive of the educational process or endangers persons or property or whose conduct off school grounds is violative of such policy and is seriously disruptive of the educational process. In making a determination as to whether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, the administration may consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (1) Whether the incident occurred within close proximity of a school; (2) whether other students from the school were involved or whether there was any gang involvement; (3) whether the conduct involved violence, threats of violence or the unlawful use of a weapon, as defined in section 29-38, and whether any injuries occurred; and (4) whether the conduct involved the use of alcohol. Any such board may authorize the administration to suspend transportation services for any pupil whose conduct while awaiting or receiving transportation to and from school endangers persons or property or is violative of a publicized policy of such board. Unless an emergency exists, no pupil shall be suspended without an informal hearing by the administration, at which such pupil shall be informed of the reasons for the disciplinary action and given an opportunity to explain the situation, provided nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a more formal hearing from being held if the circumstances surrounding the incident so require, and further provided no pupil shall be suspended more than ten times or a total of fifty days in one school year, whichever results in fewer days of exclusion, unless such pupil is granted a formal hearing pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a. If an emergency situation exists, such hearing shall be held as soon after the suspension as possible.

(b) In determining the length of a suspension period, the administration may receive and consider evidence of past disciplinary problems which have led to removal from a classroom, suspension or expulsion of such pupil.

(c) Whenever any administration suspends a pupil, such administration shall not later than twenty-four hours after the suspension notify the superintendent or such superintendent’s designee as to the name of the pupil against whom such disciplinary action was taken and the reason therefor.

(d) Any pupil who is suspended shall be given an opportunity to complete any classwork including, but not limited to, examinations which such pupil missed during the period of suspension.

(e) For any pupil who is suspended for the first time pursuant to this section and who has never been expelled pursuant to section 10-233d, the administration may shorten the length of or waive the suspension period if the pupil successfully completes an administration-specified program and meets any other conditions required by the administration. Such administration-specified program shall not require the pupil or the parent or guardian of the pupil to pay for participation in the program.

(f) Whenever a pupil is suspended pursuant to the provisions of this section, notice of the suspension and the conduct for which the pupil was suspended shall be included on the pupil’s cumulative educational record. Such notice shall be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education if a pupil graduates from high school, or in the case of a suspension of a pupil for which the length of the suspension period is shortened or the suspension period is waived pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, such notice shall be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education (1) if the pupil graduates from high school, or (2) if the administration so chooses, at the time the pupil completes the administration-specified program and meets any other conditions required by the administration pursuant to said subsection (e), whichever is earlier.

(g) On and after July 1, 2010, suspensions pursuant to this section shall be in-school suspensions, unless during the hearing held pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, (1) the administration determines that the pupil being suspended poses such a danger to persons or property or such a disruption of the educational process that the pupil shall be excluded from school during the period of suspension, or (2) the administration determines that an out-of-school suspension is appropriate for such pupil based on evidence of (A) previous disciplinary problems that have led to suspensions or expulsion of such pupil, and (B) efforts by the administration to address such disciplinary problems through means other than out-of-school suspension or expulsion, including positive behavioral support strategies. An in-school suspension may be served in the school that the pupil attends, or in any school building under the jurisdiction of the local or regional board of education, as determined by such board.

#### Section 10-233d: Expulsion of pupils.

(a)(1) Any local or regional board of education, at a meeting at which three or more members of such board are present, or the impartial hearing board established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, may expel, subject to the provisions of this subsection, any pupil whose conduct on school grounds or at a school-sponsored activity is violative of a publicized policy of such board or is seriously disruptive of the educational process or endangers persons or property or whose conduct off school grounds is violative of such policy and is seriously disruptive of the educational process, provided a majority of the board members sitting in the expulsion hearing vote to expel and that at least three affirmative votes for expulsion are cast. In making a determination as to whether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, the board of education or impartial hearing board may consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (A) Whether the incident occurred within close proximity of a school; (B) whether other students from the school were involved or whether there was any gang involvement; (C) whether the conduct involved violence, threats of violence or the unlawful use of a weapon, as defined in section 29-38, and whether any injuries occurred; and (D) whether the conduct involved the use of alcohol.

(2) Expulsion proceedings pursuant to this section, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section shall be required whenever there is reason to believe that any pupil (A) on school grounds or at a school-sponsored activity, was in possession of a firearm, as defined in 18 USC 921, as amended from time to time, or deadly weapon, dangerous instrument or martial arts weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, (B) off school grounds, did possess such a firearm in violation of section 29-35 or did possess and use such a firearm, instrument or weapon in the commission of a crime under chapter 952, or (C) on or off school grounds, offered for sale or distribution a controlled substance, as defined in subdivision (9) of section 21a-240, whose manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription, dispensing, transporting or possessing with intent to sell or dispense, offering, or administering is subject to criminal penalties under sections 21a-277 and 21a-278. Such a pupil shall be expelled for one calendar year if the local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board finds that the pupil did so possess or so possess and use, as appropriate, such a firearm, instrument or weapon or did so offer for sale or distribution such a controlled substance, provided the board of education or the hearing board may modify the period of expulsion for a pupil on a case by case basis, and as provided for in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section.

(3) Unless an emergency exists, no pupil shall be expelled without a formal hearing held pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a, provided whenever such pupil is a minor, the notice required by section 4-177 and section 4-180 shall also be given to the parents or guardian of the pupil. If an emergency exists, such hearing shall be held as soon after the expulsion as possible. The notice shall include information concerning legal services provided free of charge or at a reduced rate that are available locally and how to access such services.

(b) For purposes of conducting expulsion hearings as required by subsection (a) of this section, any local or regional board of education or any two or more of such boards in cooperation may establish an impartial hearing board of one or more persons. No member of any such board or boards shall be a member of the hearing board. The hearing board shall have the authority to conduct the expulsion hearing and render a final decision in accordance with the provisions of sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a.

(c) (1) In determining the length of an expulsion and the nature of the alternative educational opportunity to be offered under subsection (d) of this section, the local or regional board of education, or the impartial hearing board established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, may receive and consider evidence of past disciplinary problems that have led to removal from a classroom, suspension or expulsion of such pupil.

(2) For any pupil expelled for the first time pursuant to this section and who has never been suspended pursuant to section 10-233c, except for a pupil who has been expelled based on possession of a firearm or deadly weapon as described in subsection (a) of this section, the local or regional board of education may shorten the length of or waive the expulsion period if the pupil successfully completes a board-specified program and meets any other conditions required by the board. Such board-specified program shall not require the pupil or the parent or guardian of the pupil to pay for participation in the program.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-220, local and regional boards of education shall only be required to offer an alternative educational opportunity in accordance with this section. Any pupil under sixteen years of age who is expelled shall be offered an alternative educational opportunity during the period of expulsion, provided any parent or guardian of such pupil who does not choose to have his or her child enrolled in an alternative educational program shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10-184. Any pupil expelled for the first time who is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen and who wishes to continue his or her education shall be offered an alternative educational opportunity if he or she complies with conditions established by his or her local or regional board of education. Such alternative educational opportunity may include, but shall not be limited to, the placement of a pupil who is at least seventeen years of age in an adult education program pursuant to section 10-69. Any pupil participating in an adult education program during a period of expulsion shall not be required to withdraw from school under section 10-184. A local or regional board of education shall count the expulsion of a pupil when he was under sixteen years of age for purposes of determining whether an alternative educational opportunity is required for such pupil when he is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. A local or regional board of education may offer an alternative educational opportunity to a pupil for whom such alternative educational opportunity is not required pursuant to this section.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d) of this section concerning the provision of an alternative educational opportunity for pupils between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, local and regional boards of education shall not be required to offer such alternative to any pupil between the ages of sixteen and eighteen who is expelled because of conduct which endangers persons if it is determined at the expulsion hearing that the conduct for which the pupil is expelled involved (1) possession of a firearm, as defined in 18 USC 921, as amended from time to time, or deadly weapon, dangerous instrument or martial arts weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, on school property or at a school-sponsored activity, or (2) offering for sale or distribution on school property or at a school-sponsored activity a controlled substance, as defined in subdivision (9) of section 21a-240, whose manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription, dispensing, transporting or possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, or administration is subject to criminal penalties under sections 21a-277 and 21a-278. If a pupil is expelled pursuant to this section for possession of a firearm or deadly weapon the board of education shall report the violation to the local police department or in the case of a student enrolled in a technical high school to the state police. If a pupil is expelled pursuant to this section for the sale or distribution of such a controlled substance, the board of education shall refer the pupil to an appropriate state or local agency for rehabilitation, intervention or job training, or any combination thereof, and inform the agency of its action. Whenever a local or regional board of education notifies a pupil between the ages of sixteen and eighteen or the parents or guardian of such pupil that an expulsion hearing will be held, the notification shall include a statement that the board of education is not required to offer an alternative educational opportunity to any pupil who is found to have engaged in the conduct described in this subsection.

(f) Whenever a pupil is expelled pursuant to the provisions of this section, notice of the expulsion and the conduct for which the pupil was expelled shall be included on the pupil’s cumulative educational record. Such notice, except for notice of an expulsion of a pupil in grades nine to twelve, inclusive, based on possession of a firearm or deadly weapon as described in subsection (a) of this section, (1) shall be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education if a pupil graduates from high school, or (2) may be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education before a pupil graduates from high school if (A) in the case of a pupil for which the length of the expulsion period is shortened or the expulsion period is waived pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, such board determines that an expungement is warranted at the time such pupil completes the board-specified program and meets any other conditions required by such board pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, or (B) such pupil has demonstrated to such board that the conduct and behavior of such pupil in the years following such expulsion warrants an expungement. A local or regional board of education, in determining whether to expunge such notice under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, may receive and consider evidence of any subsequent disciplinary problems that have led to removal from a classroom, suspension or expulsion of such pupil.

(g) A local or regional board of education may adopt the decision of a pupil expulsion hearing conducted by another school district provided such local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board shall hold a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section which shall be limited to a determination of whether the conduct which was the basis for the expulsion would also warrant expulsion under the policies of such board. The pupil shall be excluded from school pending such hearing. The excluded student shall be offered an alternative educational opportunity in accordance with the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section.

(h) Whenever a pupil against whom an expulsion hearing is pending withdraws from school after notification of such hearing but before the hearing is completed and a decision rendered pursuant to this section, (1) notice of the pending expulsion hearing shall be included on the pupil’s cumulative educational record, and (2) the local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board shall complete the expulsion hearing and render a decision. If such pupil enrolls in school in another school district, such pupil shall not be excluded from school in the other district pending completion of the expulsion hearing pursuant to this subsection unless an emergency exists, provided nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the local or regional board of education for such district to suspend the pupil or to conduct its own expulsion hearing in accordance with this section.

(i) Prior to conducting an expulsion hearing for a child requiring special education and related services described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a, a planning and placement team shall convene to determine whether the misconduct was caused by the child’s disability. If it is determined that the misconduct was caused by the child’s disability, the child shall not be expelled. The planning and placement team shall reevaluate the child for the purpose of modifying the child’s individualized education program to address the misconduct and to ensure the safety of other children and staff in the school. If it is determined that the misconduct was not caused by the child’s disability, the child may be expelled in accordance with the provisions of this section applicable to children who do not require special education and related services. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section, whenever a child requiring such special education and related services is expelled, an alternative educational opportunity, consistent with such child’s educational needs shall be provided during the period of expulsion.

(j) An expelled pupil may apply for early readmission to school. Except as provided in this subsection, such readmission shall be at the discretion of the local or regional board of education. The board of education may delegate authority for readmission decisions to the superintendent of schools for the school district. If the board delegates such authority, readmission shall be at the discretion of the superintendent. Readmission decisions shall not be subject to appeal to Superior Court. The board or superintendent, as appropriate, may condition such readmission on specified criteria.

(k) Local and regional boards of education shall submit to the Commissioner of Education such information on expulsions for the possession of weapons as required for purposes of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, 20 USC 8921 et seq., as amended from time to time.

(l) (1) Any student who commits an expellable offense and is subsequently committed to a juvenile detention center, the Connecticut Juvenile Training School or any other residential placement for such offense may be expelled by a local or regional board of education in accordance with the provisions of this section. The period of expulsion shall run concurrently with the period of commitment to a juvenile detention center, the Connecticut Juvenile Training School or any other residential placement.

(2) If a student who committed an expellable offense seeks to return to a school district after having been in a juvenile detention center, the Connecticut Juvenile Training School or any other residential placement and such student has not been expelled by the local or regional board of education for such offense under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the local or regional board of education for the school district to which the student is returning shall allow such student to return and may not expel the student for additional time for such offense.

The notification shall include the child’s name and date of birth, the address of the child’s parents or guardian, placement location and contact information, and such other information as is necessary to provide educational services to the child.

(6) Prior to the child’s discharge from the juvenile detention facility, an assessment of the school work completed by the child shall be conducted by the local or regional board of education responsible for the provision of educational services to children in the juvenile detention facility to determine an assignment of academic credit for the work completed. Credit assigned shall be the credit of the local or regional board of education responsible for the provision of the educational services. Credit assigned for work completed by the child shall be accepted in transfer by the local or regional board of education for the school district in which the child continues his or her education after discharge from the juvenile detention facility.

With respect to the assessment year in any town in which a revaluation required under section 12-62 becomes effective, the real estate ratio used for the purposes of this section shall be the assessment rate under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-62a adjusted for any phase-in pursuant to section 12-62c. Said ratio as determined with respect to any town shall be used by the secretary to compute the equalized net grand list for such town for purposes of any grant that may be payable to such town under the provisions of section 10-262i, provided the sales assessment ratio used to compute the equalized net grand list of each town shall be calculated using uniform procedures for all towns. The equalized net grand list in such town shall consist of the assessed value of all real property on the net grand list divided by said ratio, plus the assessed value of all personal property on such net grand list divided by the assessment ratio in current use in such town.

(b) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall, annually, no later than the first day of August submit the equalized net grand list for each town to the State Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education for purposes of computing the amount of grant payable to any town under the provisions of said section 10-262i.

Within fifteen days following receipt of such notification, any town may appeal to the secretary for a hearing concerning such equalized net grand list, provided such appeal shall be in writing and include a statement as to the reasons for such appeal. The secretary shall, within fifteen days following receipt of such appeal, grant or deny such hearing by notification in writing, including in the event of denial, a statement as to the reasons for such denial. If any town is aggrieved by the action of the secretary following such hearing or in denying any such hearing, such town may, within thirty days, appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town is located. Such appeal shall be a preferred case, to be heard, unless cause appears to the contrary, at the first session, by the court. Upon all such appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed against the town at the discretion of the court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.

(d) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management is authorized to adopt regulations concerning the determinations and procedures required by this section, provided prior to such adoption a copy shall be sent to the chief executive officer and the assessor in each town and the secretary shall allow a reasonable period of time following such notification for any town to request a hearing concerning such proposed regulations or to submit recommendations.

(e) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount paid to a town pursuant to subsection (a) of this section minus the amount paid to such town under said subsection for the prior fiscal year shall be the aid increase for such town for such fiscal year.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the State Board of Education may waive such forfeiture upon agreement with the town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district that the town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district shall increase its budgeted appropriation for education during the fiscal year in which the forfeiture would occur by an amount not less than the amount of said forfeiture or for other good cause shown.

(2) In determining whether an application shall be approved and funds awarded pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (A) Whether the program offered by the school is likely to increase student achievement; (B) whether the program is likely to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation; (C) the percentage of the student enrollment in the program from each participating district; and (D) the proposed operating budget and the sources of funding for the interdistrict magnet school. For a magnet school not operated by a local or regional board of education, the commissioner shall only approve a proposed operating budget that, on a per pupil basis, does not exceed the maximum allowable threshold established in accordance with this subdivision. The maximum allowable threshold shall be an amount equal to one hundred twenty per cent of the state average of the quotient obtained by dividing net current expenditures, as defined in section 10-261, by average daily membership, as defined in said section, for the fiscal year two years prior to the fiscal year for which the operating grant is requested. The Department of Education shall establish the maximum allowable threshold no later than December fifteenth of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the operating grant is requested. If requested by an applicant that is not a local or regional board of education, the commissioner may approve a proposed operating budget that exceeds the maximum allowable threshold if the commissioner determines that there are extraordinary programmatic needs. In the case of an interdistrict magnet school that will assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall also consider whether the school is meeting the reduced-isolation setting standards set forth in such 2013 stipulation and order. If such school has not met the reduced-isolation setting standards prescribed in such 2013 stipulation and order, it shall not be entitled to receive a grant pursuant to this section unless the commissioner finds that it is appropriate to award a grant for an additional year or years for purposes of compliance with such 2013 stipulation and order. If requested by the commissioner, the applicant shall meet with the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee to discuss the budget and sources of funding.

(3) Except as provided in this section, section 197 of public act 11-48\* and the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., the commissioner shall not award a grant to (A) a program that is in operation prior to July 1, 2005, if more than eighty per cent of its total enrollment is from one school district, except that the commissioner may award a grant for good cause, for any one year, on behalf of an otherwise eligible magnet school program, if more than eighty per cent of the total enrollment is from one district, and (B) a program that begins operations on or after July 1, 2005, if more than seventy-five per cent of its total enrollment is from one school district or if less than twenty-five or more than seventy-five per cent of the students enrolled are pupils of racial minorities, as defined in section 10-226a, except that the commissioner may award a grant for good cause, for one year, on behalf of an otherwise eligible interdistrict magnet school program, if more than seventy-five per cent of the total enrollment is from one district or less than twenty-five or more than seventy-five per cent of the students enrolled are pupils of racial minorities. The commissioner may not award grants pursuant to the exceptions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision for an additional consecutive year or years, except as provided for in section 197 of public act 11-48\*, the 2008 stipulation for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as determined by the commissioner.

(d) (1) Grants made pursuant to this section, except those made pursuant to subdivision (6) of subsection (c) of this section and subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be paid as follows: Seventy per cent not later than September first and the balance not later than May first of each fiscal year. The May first payment shall be adjusted to reflect actual interdistrict magnet school program enrollment as of the preceding October first using the data of record as of the intervening March first, if the actual level of enrollment is lower than the projected enrollment stated in the approved grant application. The May first payment shall be further adjusted for the difference between the total grant received by the magnet school operator in the prior fiscal year and the revised total grant amount calculated for the prior fiscal year in cases where the aggregate financial audit submitted by the interdistrict magnet school operator pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (n) of this section indicates an overpayment by the department.

(2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, and each fiscal year thereafter, grants made pursuant to subparagraph (E) of subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section shall be paid as follows: Thirty per cent of the amount not later than August first based on estimated student enrollment on July first, thirty per cent of the amount not later than October first based on estimated student enrollment on September first, and the balance not later than May first of each fiscal year. The May first payment shall be adjusted to reflect actual interdistrict magnet school program enrollment for those students who have been enrolled at such school for at least two of three trimesters of the school year, using the data of record.

(e) The Department of Education may retain up to one-half of one per cent of the amount appropriated, in an amount not to exceed five hundred thousand dollars, for purposes of this section for program evaluation and administration.

(f) Each local or regional school district in which an interdistrict magnet school is located shall provide the same kind of transportation to its children enrolled in such interdistrict magnet school as it provides to its children enrolled in other public schools in such local or regional school district. The parent or guardian of a child denied the transportation services required to be provided pursuant to this subsection may appeal such denial in the manner provided in sections 10-186 and 10-187.

(g) On or before October fifteenth of each year, the Commissioner of Education shall determine if interdistrict magnet school enrollment is below the number of students for which funds were appropriated. If the commissioner determines that the enrollment is below such number, the additional funds shall not lapse but shall be used by the commissioner for grants for interdistrict cooperative programs pursuant to section 10-74d.

(h) In the case of a student identified as requiring special education, the school district in which the student resides shall: (1) Hold the planning and placement team meeting for such student and shall invite representatives from the interdistrict magnet school to participate in such meeting; and (2) pay the interdistrict magnet school an amount equal to the difference between the reasonable cost of educating such student and the sum of the amount received by the interdistrict magnet school for such student pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and amounts received from other state, federal, local or private sources calculated on a per pupil basis. Such school district shall be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to section 10-76g. If a student requiring special education attends an interdistrict magnet school on a full-time basis, such interdistrict magnet school shall be responsible for ensuring that such student receives the services mandated by the student’s individualized education program whether such services are provided by the interdistrict magnet school or by the school district in which the student resides.

(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the enrollment of nonpublic school students in an interdistrict magnet school program that operates less than full-time, provided (1) such students constitute no more than five per cent of the full-time equivalent enrollment in such magnet school program, and (2) such students are not counted for purposes of determining the amount of grants pursuant to this section and section 10-264i.

(j) After accommodating students from participating districts in accordance with an approved enrollment agreement, an interdistrict magnet school operator that has unused student capacity may enroll directly into its program any interested student. A student from a district that is not participating in an interdistrict magnet school or the interdistrict student attendance program pursuant to section 10-266aa to an extent determined by the Commissioner of Education shall be given preference. The local or regional board of education otherwise responsible for educating such student shall contribute funds to support the operation of the interdistrict magnet school in an amount equal to the per student tuition, if any, charged to participating districts.

(k) (1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and each fiscal year thereafter, any tuition charged to a local or regional board of education by a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school or any tuition charged by the Hartford school district operating the Great Path Academy on behalf of Manchester Community College for any student enrolled in kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, in such interdistrict magnet school shall be in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the average per pupil expenditure of the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (B) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis. If any such board of education fails to pay such tuition, the commissioner may withhold from such board’s town or towns a sum payable under section 10-262i in an amount not to exceed the amount of the unpaid tuition to the magnet school and pay such money to the fiscal agent for the magnet school as a supplementary grant for the operation of the interdistrict magnet school program. In no case shall the sum of such tuitions exceed the difference between (i) the total expenditures of the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the total per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of a magnet school to verify such tuition rate.

(2) (A) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2014, a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school offering a preschool program that is not located in the Sheff region may charge tuition to the Department of Education for a child enrolled in such preschool program in an amount not to exceed an amount equal to the difference between (i) the average per pupil expenditure of the preschool program offered at the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of any such magnet school charging such tuition to verify such tuition rate. For purposes of this subdivision, “Sheff region” means the school districts for the towns of Avon, Bloomfield, Canton, East Granby, East Hartford, East Windsor, Ellington, Farmington, Glastonbury, Granby, Hartford, Manchester, Newington, Rocky Hill, Simsbury, South Windsor, Suffield, Vernon, West Hartford, Wethersfield, Windsor and Windsor Locks.

(B) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, and each fiscal year thereafter, a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school offering a preschool program that is not located in the Sheff region may charge tuition to the parent or guardian of a child enrolled in such preschool program in an amount that is in accordance with the sliding tuition scale adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to section 10-264p. The Department of Education shall be financially responsible for any unpaid portion of the tuition not charged to such parent or guardian under such sliding tuition scale. Such tuition shall not exceed an amount equal to the difference between (i) the average per pupil expenditure of the preschool program offered at the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of any such magnet school charging such tuition to verify such tuition rate.

(l) A participating district shall provide opportunities for its students to attend an interdistrict magnet school in a number that is at least equal to the number specified in any written agreement with an interdistrict magnet school operator or in a number that is at least equal to the average number of students that the participating district enrolled in such magnet school during the previous three school years.

(m) On or before May 15, 2010, and annually thereafter, each interdistrict magnet school operator shall provide written notification to any school district that is otherwise responsible for educating a student who resides in such school district and will be enrolled in an interdistrict magnet school under the operator’s control for the following school year. Such notification shall include the number of any such students, by grade, who will be enrolled in an interdistrict magnet school under the control of such operator, the name of the school in which such student has been placed and the amount of tuition to be charged to the local or regional board of education for such student. Such notification shall represent an estimate of the number of students expected to attend such interdistrict magnet schools in the following school year, but shall not be deemed to limit the number of students who may enroll in such interdistrict magnet schools for such year.

(n) (1) Each interdistrict magnet school operator shall annually file with the Commissioner of Education, at such time and in such manner as the commissioner prescribes, (A) a financial audit for each interdistrict magnet school operated by such operator, and (B) an aggregate financial audit for all of the interdistrict magnet schools operated by such operator.

(2) Annually, the commissioner shall randomly select one interdistrict magnet school operated by a regional educational service center to be subject to a comprehensive financial audit conducted by an auditor selected by the commissioner. The regional educational service center shall be responsible for all costs associated with the audit conducted pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.

(o) For the school years commencing July 1, 2009, to July 1, 2014, inclusive, any local or regional board of education operating an interdistrict magnet school pursuant to the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., shall not charge tuition for any student enrolled in a preschool program or in kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, in an interdistrict magnet school operated by such school district, except the Hartford school district may charge tuition for any student enrolled in the Great Path Academy.

Commencing with grant applications submitted during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1994, and for each fiscal year thereafter, in which funds are available pursuant to section 10-265d, the Commissioner of Education shall have the authority to receive, review and approve or disapprove applications for state grants to local or regional boards of education, regional educational service centers or school districts entering into cooperative arrangements for the purchase of vocational education equipment as defined in section 10-265a. Applications shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Education annually at such time and on such forms as the commissioner prescribes. The Commissioner of Education shall annually review and approve or disapprove each application and notify the applicant of the approval or disapproval of each application and, if the application is approved, of the amount of the estimated grant pursuant to section 10-265c. The commissioner shall authorize grant payments based upon such approved grant application from the local or regional board of education, regional educational service center or the board of education designated as the fiscal agent for school districts entering into cooperative arrangements. Only funds derived from local sources and the state grant paid to the applicant pursuant to this section shall be used in determining the final amount of each vocational education equipment grant. Each recipient of a grant pursuant to said section 10-265c shall submit a report of expenditures to the Commissioner of Education at such time and in such manner as the commissioner prescribes. The commissioner shall calculate any overpayment of the grant paid and the recipient shall return any such portion of a grant within sixty days after receipt of a written notice by the commissioner of such overpayment. In no event shall an adjustment result in a recipient being entitled to a grant greater than that already paid.

#### Section 10-265c: Distribution of funds. Grant application; limitations.

Within the limits of the bond authorization, a local or regional board of education, regional educational service center or school districts entering into cooperative arrangements eligible to receive a grant pursuant to section 10-265b, shall receive not less than forty nor more than eighty per cent of the net purchase price of vocational education equipment except as otherwise provided in this section. For a local or regional board of education such percentage shall be determined pursuant to section 10-285a. For a regional educational service center or school districts entering into cooperative arrangements, such percentage shall be determined by its respective ranking. Such ranking shall be determined by (1) multiplying the total population, as defined in section 10-261, of each member town by such town’s percentile ranking, as determined in subsection (a) of section 10-285a; (2) adding together the figures for each town determined under subdivision (1) of this section; and (3) dividing the total computed under subdivision (2) of this section by the total population of all member towns. The ranking of each regional educational service center or school district entering into cooperative arrangements shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and such center or school district shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as would a town with the same rank. Such percentage shall be increased by ten per cent whenever a regional educational service center or two or more local or regional boards of education purchase equipment pursuant to a cooperative arrangement for the purpose of providing a program of vocational education. For purposes of approving grant applications, school districts will be ranked, from highest to lowest, based on each member town’s adjusted equalized net grand list per capita, as defined in section 10-261. Regional school districts, regional educational service centers and school districts entering into cooperative arrangements will be assigned a rank through a population weighted average of member towns’ adjusted equalized net grand list per capita rank. Grant applications shall be approved based on wealth rank beginning with the lowest wealth-ranked applicant. Applications approved pursuant to this section shall not exceed the bond authorization. Commencing with applications submitted for a grant for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1984, and annually thereafter, no school district shall be eligible to receive a grant under this section more than once every three years.

Eligibility for grants pursuant to this section shall be determined for a five-year period based on a school district’s designation as a priority school district or as a school district in which a priority elementary school is located for the initial year of application. In order to receive a grant, an eligible board of education shall submit a plan for the expenditure of grant funds, in accordance with this section, to the Department of Education, at such time and in such manner as the commissioner prescribes. An eligible school district may receive a grant for one or more purposes pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection, provided at least fifty per cent of any grant funds received by such school district are used for programs pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection. If the commissioner determines the school district is addressing the issue of early reading intervention sufficiently, the commissioner may allow the school district to set aside a smaller percentage of the funds received pursuant to this section for such programs.

(b) (1) In the case of proposals for full-day kindergarten programs, the plan shall include: (A) Information on the number of full-day kindergarten classes that will be offered initially and the number of children to be enrolled in such classes; (B) how the board anticipates expanding the number of full-day kindergarten programs in future school years; (C) the number of additional teachers needed and any additional equipment needed for purposes of such programs; (D) a description of any proposed school building project that is related to the need for additional space for full-day kindergarten programs, including an analysis of the different options available to meet such need, such as relocatable classrooms, the division of existing classrooms, an addition to a building or new construction; (E) information on the curriculum for the full-day kindergarten program pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection; (F) information on coordination between the full-day kindergarten program and school readiness programs for the purpose of providing (i) information concerning transition from preschool to kindergarten, including the child’s preschool records, and (ii) before and after school child care for children attending the full-day kindergarten program; and (G) any additional information the commissioner deems relevant.

(2) A full-day kindergarten program that receives funding pursuant to this subsection shall: (A) Include language development and appropriate reading readiness experiences; (B) provide for the assessment of a student’s progress; (C) include a professional development component in the teaching of reading and reading readiness and assessment of reading competency for kindergarten teachers; (D) provide for parental involvement; and (E) refer eligible children who do not have health insurance to the HUSKY program.

(c) (1) In the case of proposals for the reduction of class size in grades kindergarten to three, inclusive, to not more than eighteen students the plan shall include: (A) A time frame for achieving such reduction in class size; (B) information on the class size in such grades at each school at the time of application for the grant and the number of classes to be reduced in size with grant funds; (C) the number of additional teachers needed and any additional equipment needed; (D) a description of any proposed school building project related to the need for additional space for smaller classes, including an analysis of the different options available to meet such need such as relocatable classrooms, the division of existing classrooms, an addition to a building or new construction; (E) an estimate of the costs associated with implementation of the plan; and (F) any additional information the commissioner deems relevant.

(2) If a school district accepts funds pursuant to this subsection, such school district shall limit the class size of classes in which core curriculum is taught in grades kindergarten to three, inclusive, in accordance with its plan to eighteen or less students, provided students who enroll after October first in any school year are not included for purposes of such count.

Each school district that receives grant funds under this section shall annually report to the Department of Education on the district’s progress toward reducing the achievement gap in reading, including data on student progress in reading and how such data have been used to guide professional development and the coaching process.

(e) (1) The model programs established pursuant to section 10-265j shall be funded from the amount appropriated for purposes of this section. The department shall use ninety per cent of the remaining funds appropriated for purposes of this section for grants to priority school districts. Priority school districts shall receive grants based on their proportional share of the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the number of enrolled kindergarten students in each priority school district for the year prior to the year the grant is to be paid, by the ratio of the average percentage of free and reduced price meals for all severe need schools in such district to the minimum percentage requirement for severe need school eligibility. (2) The department shall use nine per cent of such remaining funds for competitive grants to school districts in which a priority elementary school is located. In awarding grants to school districts in which priority elementary schools are located, the department shall consider the town wealth, as defined in subdivision (26) of section 10-262f, of the town in which the school district is located, or in the case of regional school districts, the towns which comprise the regional school district.

#### Section 10-265g: Summer reading programs required for priority school districts. Evaluation of student reading level. Individual reading plan.

(a) Each local and regional board of education for a priority school district shall offer a summer reading program, as described in subsection (d) of section 10-265f, to children enrolled in kindergarten in the schools under its jurisdiction who are determined by their school to be substantially deficient in reading based on measures established by the State Board of Education.

(b) For the school year commencing July 1, 2011, and each school year thereafter, each local and regional board of education for a priority school district shall require the schools under its jurisdiction to assess the reading level of students enrolled in (1) kindergarten at the end of the school year, and (2) grades one to three, inclusive, at the beginning, middle and end of the school year. A student shall be determined to be substantially deficient in reading based on measures established by the State Board of Education. Each school shall provide instruction for such students that incorporates the competencies required for early reading success and effective reading instruction as delineated in section 10-221l. If a student is determined to be substantially deficient in reading based on the beginning, middle or end of the school year assessment, the school shall notify the parents or guardian of the student of such result and the school shall develop and implement an individual reading plan for such student.

(c) The individual reading plan shall include assessment results, applicable federal requirements and additional instruction, within available appropriations, such as tutoring, an after school, school vacation, or weekend program or a summer reading program as described in subsection (d) of section 10-265f. Individual reading plans pursuant to this section shall be (1) reviewed and revised as appropriate after each assessment or state-wide examination, as appropriate, (2) monitored by school literacy teams that shall consist of, but not be limited to, teachers, school reading specialists, internal or external reading consultants, the school principal and the provider of the additional instruction, and (3) given to the parent or guardian of the student, in accordance with the provisions concerning notice to parents or legal guardians pursuant to section 10-15b, and include specific recommendations for reading strategies that the parent or guardian can use at home. For purposes of providing additional instruction, boards of education for priority school districts shall give preference first to elementary schools and then to middle schools, with the highest number of students who are substantially deficient in reading.

(d) Educational and instructional decisions for students with individual reading plans from kindergarten, first, second or third grade shall be based on documented progress in achieving the goals of the individual reading plan or demonstrated reading proficiency. If a decision is made to promote a student who is substantially deficient in reading from kindergarten, first, second or third grade, the school principal shall provide written justification for such promotion to the superintendent of schools.

(e) An individual reading plan that incorporates the competencies required for early reading success and explicit reading instruction as delineated in section 10-221l shall be maintained for a student who is substantially deficient in reading until the student achieves grade level proficiency, as determined by a reading assessment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or a mastery examination, pursuant to section 10-14n.

(f) Subject to the provisions of this subsection and within available appropriations, each local and regional board of education for a priority school district shall require for the school year commencing July 1, 2011, and each school year thereafter, students in kindergarten to grade three, inclusive, who, based on an end-of-the-year assessment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, are determined to be substantially deficient in reading, to attend school the summer following such evaluation. The superintendent of schools may exempt an individual student from such requirement, upon the recommendation of the school principal, based on the student’s progress with the student’s individual reading plan. If a student does not receive such an exemption, has been offered the opportunity to attend a summer school program and fails to attend summer school, the local or regional board of education shall not promote the student to the next grade.

(1) The percentage of pupil transportation costs reimbursed to a local board of education shall be determined by (A) ranking each town in the state in descending order from one to one hundred sixty-nine according to such town’s adjusted equalized net grand list per capita, as defined in section 10-261; (B) based upon such ranking, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2-32a, (i) except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a percentage of zero shall be assigned to towns ranked from one to thirteen and a percentage of not less than zero nor more than sixty shall be determined for the towns ranked from fourteen to one hundred sixty-nine on a continuous scale, except that any such percentage shall be increased by twenty percentage points in accordance with section 10-97, where applicable, and (ii) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, and for each fiscal year thereafter, a percentage of zero shall be assigned to towns ranked from one to seventeen and a percentage of not less than zero nor more than sixty shall be determined for the towns ranked from eighteen to one hundred sixty-nine on a continuous scale.

(2) The percentage of pupil transportation costs reimbursed to a regional board of education shall be determined by its ranking. Such ranking shall be determined by (A) multiplying the total population, as defined in section 10-261, of each town in the district by such town’s ranking, as determined in subdivision (1) of this subsection, (B) adding together the figures determined under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, and (C) dividing the total computed under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision by the total population of all towns in the district. The ranking of each regional board of education shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and each such board shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as would a town with the same rank, provided such percentage shall be increased in the case of a secondary regional school district by an additional five percentage points and, in the case of any other regional school district by an additional ten percentage points.

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, and for each fiscal year thereafter, no local or regional board of education shall receive a grant of less than one thousand dollars.

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2015, inclusive, the amount of transportation grants payable to local or regional boards of education shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for such grants for such year.

(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Education may provide grants, within available appropriations, in an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars per pupil, to local and regional boards of education and regional educational service centers that transport (A) out-of-district students to technical high schools located in Hartford, or (B) Hartford students attending a technical high school or a regional agricultural science and technology education center outside of the district, to assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as determined by the commissioner, for the costs associated with such transportation.

(6) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, in addition to the reimbursements and grants payable under subdivisions (1) to (5), inclusive, of this subsection, the Commissioner of Education shall provide a grant when (A) two or more boards of education enter into a cooperative agreement in accordance with section 10-158a to transport students to schools operated by the boards of education during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, and (B) such cooperative arrangement results in a savings, as determined by the commissioner, over the transportation costs incurred by the boards of education during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. This grant, which shall be returned to the municipalities in which the participating boards of education are located in accordance with the terms of the written cooperative arrangement, shall be equal to half of the difference in the amount the boards of education would have been reimbursed in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, for pupil transportation costs but for the savings realized in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, pursuant to the cooperative arrangement.

(b) A cooperative arrangement established pursuant to section 10-158a which provides transportation in accordance with said section shall be reimbursed for a percentage of such transportation costs in accordance with its ranking pursuant to this subsection. The ranking shall be determined by (1) multiplying the total population, as defined in section 10-261, of each town in the cooperative arrangement by such town’s ranking as determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, (2) adding such products, and (3) dividing such sum by the total population of all towns in the cooperative arrangement. The ranking of each cooperative arrangement shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and each cooperative arrangement shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as a town with the same rank.

The grants shall provide funds for extended school building hours for public schools in such districts for academic enrichment and support, and recreation programs for students in the districts. Such programs may be conducted in buildings other than public school buildings, provided the board of education is able to demonstrate to the commissioner that the facility in which the program will be run can adequately support the academic goals of the program and a plan is in place to provide adequate academic instruction.

(b) The Commissioner of Education shall provide a grant estimate annually to each priority school district. The estimated grant shall be calculated as follows: Each district’s average daily membership, as defined in subdivision (2) of section 10-261, divided by the total of all priority school districts’ average daily membership, multiplied by the amount appropriated for the grant program minus the amounts specified in subsections (a) and (b) of section 10-266u.

(c) (1) Annually, each such district shall file a grant application with the Commissioner of Education, in such form and at such time as he prescribes. The application shall identify the local distribution of funds by school and operator, with program specification, hours and days of operation.

(2) Each such district shall solicit applications for individual school programs, on a competitive basis, from town and nonprofit agencies, prioritize the applications and select applications for funding within the total grant amount allocated to the district. District decisions to fund individual school programs shall be based on specified criteria including: (A) Total hours of operation, (B) number of students served, (C) total student hours of service, (D) total program cost, (E) estimate of volunteer hours, or other sources of support, (F) community involvement, commitment and support, (G) nonduplication of existing services, (H) needs of the student body of the school, (I) unique qualities of the proposal, and (J) responsiveness to the requirements of this section and section 10-266u. Each district shall submit to the commissioner all proposals received as part of its grant application and documentation of the review and ranking process for such proposals.

(3) Grants to individual school programs shall be limited to a range of twenty to eighty thousand dollars per school, based on school enrollment.

(d) Each district, shall: (1) Demonstrate, in its grant application, that a district-wide and school building needs assessment was conducted, including an inventory of existing academic enrichment and support, and recreational opportunities available during nonschool hours both within and outside of school buildings; (2) ensure equal program access for all students and necessary accommodations and support for students with disabilities; (3) provide a summer component, unless it is able to document that sufficient summer opportunity already exists; (4) include in its application a schedule and total number of hours that it determines to be reasonable and sufficient for individual school programs; (5) support no less than ten per cent of the cost of the total district-wide extended school building hours program and provide documentation of local dollars or in-kind contributions, or both; and (6) contract for the direct operation of the program, unless it is able to document that no providers are interested or able to provide a cost efficient program.

(e) All programs funded pursuant to this section shall: (1) Offer both academic enrichment and support and recreation experiences, (2) be open to all resident students in the district, (3) be designed to ensure communication with the child’s teacher and ties to the regular school curriculum, (4) be clearly articulated with structured and specified experiences for children but able to accommodate the irregular participation of any one child, (5) provide for community involvement, (6) investigate the use of the National Service Corps, (7) coordinate operations and activities with existing programs and the agencies which operate such programs, (8) provide for parent involvement in program planning and the use of parents as advisers and volunteers, and (9) provide for business involvement or sponsorship.

All programs which operate in a public school shall have access to existing special facilities and equipment in the public school and shall have the written endorsement of the school principal and superintendent of schools for the school district.

(f) Grant funds may be used to hire personnel to provide for the instruction and supervision of children and for necessary support costs such as food, program supplies, equipment and materials, direct cost of building maintenance, personnel supervision and transportation but shall not be used for indirect costs.

(g) The Commissioner of Education may negotiate the contents of a district’s grant application or refuse to authorize a grant if he finds the proposal costs are not reasonable or necessary or the selection of specific local building programs over others was not justified by the process and the data.

(h) Notwithstanding subsections (d) and (e) of this section, a school district may charge fees for participation in after-school academic enrichment, support or recreational programs, provided the fees are calculated on a sliding scale based on ability to pay and no fee exceeds seventy-five per cent of the average cost of participation. No school district may exclude a student from participation in such after-school academic enrichment, support and recreational programs due to inability to pay a fee.

(i) Commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, if a school district that received a grant pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for the prior fiscal year is no longer eligible to receive such a grant, such school district shall receive a phase-out grant for each of the three fiscal years following the fiscal year such school district received a grant under this section. The amount of such phase-out grants shall be determined as follows: (1) Seventy-five per cent of the amount of the final grant under this section for the first fiscal year following the fiscal year that such school district received such final grant, (2) fifty per cent of the amount of such final grant for the second fiscal year following the fiscal year that such school district received such final grant, and (3) twenty-five per cent of the amount of such final grant for the third fiscal year following the fiscal year that such school district received such final grant.

For the school year commencing in 2003, and for each school year thereafter, the voluntary enrollment program may be in operation in every priority school district in the state. Students from other school districts in the area of a priority school district, as determined by the regional educational service center pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, may attend school in the priority school district, provided such students bring racial, ethnic and economic diversity to the priority school district and do not increase the racial, ethnic and economic isolation in the priority school district.

(d) School districts which received students from New London under the program during the 2000-2001 school year shall allow such students to attend school in the district until they graduate from high school. The attendance of such students in such program shall not be supported by grants pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section but shall be supported, in the same amounts as provided for in said subsections, by interdistrict cooperative grants pursuant to section 10-74d to the regional educational service centers operating such programs.

(e) Once the program is in operation in the region served by a regional educational service center pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Department of Education shall provide an annual grant to such regional educational service center to assist school districts in its area in administering the program and to provide staff to assist students participating in the program to make the transition to a new school and to act as a liaison between the parents of such students and the new school district. Each regional educational service center shall determine which school districts in its area are located close enough to a priority school district to make participation in the program feasible in terms of student transportation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, provided any student participating in the program prior to July 1, 1999, shall be allowed to continue to attend the same school such student attended prior to said date in the receiving district until the student completes the highest grade in such school. Not later than April fifteenth of each school year, each regional educational service center shall report to the Department of Education the number of spaces available for the following school year for out-of-district students under the program. If there are more students who seek to attend school in a receiving district than there are spaces available, the regional educational service center shall assist the school district in determining attendance by the use of a lottery or lotteries designed to preserve or increase racial, ethnic and economic diversity, except that the regional educational service center shall give preference to siblings and to students who would otherwise attend a school that has lost its accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges or has been identified as in need of improvement pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act, P.L. 107-110. The admission policies shall be consistent with section 10-15c and this section. No receiving district shall recruit students under the program for athletic or extracurricular purposes. Each receiving district shall allow out-of-district students it accepts to attend school in the district until they graduate from high school.

(f) The Department of Education shall provide grants to regional educational service centers or local or regional boards of education for the reasonable cost of transportation for students participating in the program. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department shall provide such grants within available appropriations, provided the state-wide average of such grants does not exceed an amount equal to three thousand two hundred fifty dollars for each student transported, except that the Commissioner of Education may grant to regional educational service centers additional sums from funds remaining in the appropriation for such transportation services if needed to offset transportation costs that exceed such maximum amount. The regional educational service centers shall provide reasonable transportation services to high school students who wish to participate in supervised extracurricular activities. For purposes of this section, the number of students transported shall be determined on September first of each fiscal year.

(g) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the Department of Education shall provide, within available appropriations, an annual grant to the local or regional board of education for each receiving district in an amount not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program.

(2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department shall provide, within available appropriations, an annual grant to the local or regional board of education for each receiving district if one of the following conditions are met as follows: (A) Three thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program if the number of such out-of-district students is less than two per cent of the total student population of such receiving district, (B) four thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program if the number of such out-of-district students is greater than or equal to two per cent but less than three per cent of the total student population of such receiving district, (C) six thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program if the number of such out-of-district students is greater than or equal to three per cent but less than four per cent of the total student population of such receiving district, (D) six thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program if the Commissioner of Education determines that the receiving district has an enrollment of greater than four thousand students and has increased the number of students in the program by at least fifty per cent from the previous fiscal year, or (E) eight thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who attends school in the receiving district under the program if the number of such out-of-district students is greater than or equal to four per cent of the total student population of such receiving district.

(3) Each town which receives funds pursuant to this subsection shall make such funds available to its local or regional board of education in supplement to any other local appropriation, other state or federal grant or other revenue to which the local or regional board of education is entitled.

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, each sending district and each receiving district shall divide the number of children participating in the program who reside in such district or attend school in such district by two for purposes of the counts for subdivision (22) of section 10-262f and subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-261.

(i) In the case of an out-of-district student who requires special education and related services, the sending district shall pay the receiving district an amount equal to the difference between the reasonable cost of providing such special education and related services to such student and the amount received by the receiving district pursuant to subsection (g) of this section and in the case of students participating pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the per pupil amount received pursuant to section 10-74d. The sending district shall be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to section 10-76g.

(j) Nothing in this section shall prohibit school districts from charging tuition to other school districts that do not have a high school pursuant to section 10-33.

(k) On or before March first of each year, the Commissioner of Education shall determine if the enrollment in the program pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for the fiscal year is below the number of students for which funds were appropriated. If the commissioner determines that the enrollment is below such number, the additional funds shall not lapse but shall be used by the commissioner in accordance with this subsection.

(1) Any amount up to five hundred thousand dollars of such nonlapsing funds shall be used for supplemental grants to receiving districts on a pro rata basis for each out-of-district student in the program pursuant to subsection (c) of this section who attends the same school in the receiving district as at least nine other such out-of-district students, not to exceed one thousand dollars per student.

(2) Any amount of such nonlapsing funds equal to or greater than five hundred thousand dollars, but less than one million dollars, shall be used for supplemental grants, in an amount determined by the commissioner, on a pro rata basis to receiving districts that report to the commissioner on or before March first of the current school year that the number of out-of-district students enrolled in such receiving district is greater than the number of out-of-district students enrolled in such receiving district from the previous school year.

(3) Any remaining nonlapsing funds shall be used by the commissioner to increase enrollment in the interdistrict public school attendance program described in this section.

(l) For purposes of the state-wide mastery examinations under section 10-14n, students participating in the program established pursuant to this section shall be considered residents of the school district in which they attend school.

(m) Within available appropriations, the commissioner may make grants to regional education service centers which provide summer school educational programs approved by the commissioner to students participating in the program.

(n) The Commissioner of Education may provide grants for children in the Hartford program described in this section to participate in preschool and all day kindergarten programs. In addition to the subsidy provided to the receiving district for educational services, such grants may be used for the provision of before and after-school care and remedial services for the preschool and kindergarten students participating in the program.

(o) Within available appropriations, the commissioner may make grants for academic student support for programs pursuant to this section that assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as determined by the commissioner.

#### Section 10-281: Transportation for pupils in nonprofit private schools within school district.

(a) Any municipality or school district shall provide, for its children enrolled in any grade, from kindergarten to twelve, inclusive, attending nonpublic nonprofit schools therein, the same kind of transportation services provided for its children in such grades attending public schools when a majority of the children attending such a nonpublic school are residents of the state of Connecticut. Such determination shall be based on the ratio of pupils who are residents to all pupils enrolled in each such school on October first or the full school day immediately preceding such date, during the school year next preceding that in which the transportation services are to be provided. For purposes of this section, residency means continuous and permanent physical presence within the state, except that temporary absences for short periods of time shall not affect the establishment of residency. In no case shall a municipality or school district be required to expend for transportation to any nonpublic school, in any one school year, a per pupil transportation expenditure greater than an amount double the local per pupil expenditure for public school transportation during the last completed school year. In the event that such per pupil expenditure for transportation to a nonprofit nonpublic school may exceed double the local per pupil expenditure, the municipality or school district may allocate its share of said transportation on a per pupil, per school basis and may pay, at its option, its share of said transportation directly to the provider of the transportation services on a monthly basis over the period such service is provided or provide such service for a period of time which constitutes less than the entire school year. Any such municipality or school district providing transportation services under this section may suspend such services in accordance with the provisions of section 10-233c. Any such municipality or school district providing transportation under this section shall be reimbursed only for the cost of such transportation as is required by this section upon the same basis and in the same manner as such municipality or school district is reimbursed for transporting children attending its public schools. The parent or guardian of any student who is denied the kind of transportation services required to be provided by this section may seek a remedy in the same manner as is provided for parents of public school children in section 10-186 and section 10-187.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2015, inclusive, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this section shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for purposes of this section.

Any regional school board may vote to authorize the supervising agent of the regional school district to apply to the Commissioner of Administrative Services for and to accept or reject such grant for the district. Applications for such grants under this chapter shall be made by the superintendent of schools of such town or regional school district on the form provided and in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The application form shall require the superintendent of schools to affirm that the school district considered the maximization of natural light, the use and feasibility of wireless connectivity technology and, on and after July 1, 2014, the school safety infrastructure standards, developed by the School Safety Infrastructure Council, pursuant to section 10-292r, in projects for new construction and alteration or renovation of a school building. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall review each grant application for a school building project for compliance with educational requirements and on the basis of categories for building projects established by the Commissioner of Administrative Services in accordance with this section. The Commissioner of Education shall evaluate, if appropriate, whether the project will assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall consult with the Commissioner of Education in reviewing grant applications submitted for purposes of subsection (a) of section 10-65 or section 10-76e on the basis of the educational needs of the applicant. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall review each grant application for a school building project for compliance with standards for school building projects pursuant to regulations, adopted in accordance with section 10-287c, and, on and after July 1, 2014, the school safety infrastructure standards, developed by the School Safety Infrastructure Council pursuant to section 10-292r. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the Board of Trustees of the Community-Technical Colleges on behalf of Quinebaug Valley Community College and Three Rivers Community College and the following entities that will operate an interdistrict magnet school that will assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as determined by the Commissioner of Education, may apply for and shall be eligible to receive grants for school building projects pursuant to section 10-264h for such a school: (A) The Board of Trustees of the Community-Technical Colleges on behalf of a regional community-technical college, (B) the Board of Trustees of the Connecticut State University System on behalf of a state university, (C) the Board of Trustees for The University of Connecticut on behalf of the university, (D) the board of governors for an independent college or university, as defined in section 10a-37\*, or the equivalent of such a board, on behalf of the independent college or university, (E) cooperative arrangements pursuant to section 10-158a, and (F) any other third-party not-for-profit corporation approved by the Commissioner of Education.

(2) The Commissioner of Education shall assign each school building project to a category on the basis of whether such project is primarily required to: (A) Create new facilities or alter existing facilities to provide for mandatory instructional programs pursuant to this chapter, for physical education facilities in compliance with Title IX of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1972 where such programs or such compliance cannot be provided within existing facilities or for the correction of code violations which cannot be reasonably addressed within existing program space; (B) create new facilities or alter existing facilities to enhance mandatory instructional programs pursuant to this chapter or provide comparable facilities among schools to all students at the same grade level or levels within the school district unless such project is otherwise explicitly included in another category pursuant to this section; and (C) create new facilities or alter existing facilities to provide supportive services, provided in no event shall such supportive services include swimming pools, auditoriums, outdoor athletic facilities, tennis courts, elementary school playgrounds, site improvement or garages or storage, parking or general recreation areas. All applications submitted prior to July first shall be reviewed promptly by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall estimate the amount of the grant for which such project is eligible, in accordance with the provisions of section 10-285a, provided an application for a school building project determined by the Commissioner of Education to be a project that will assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., shall have until September first to submit an application for such a project and may have until December first of the same year to secure and report all local and state approvals required to complete the grant application. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall annually prepare a listing of all such eligible school building projects listed by category together with the amount of the estimated grants for such projects and shall submit the same to the Governor, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the General Assembly on or before the fifteenth day of December, except as provided in section 10-283a, with a request for authorization to enter into grant commitments. On or before December thirty-first annually, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall submit comments and recommendations regarding each eligible project on such listing of eligible school building projects to the school construction committee, established pursuant to section 10-283a. Each such listing submitted after December 15, 2005, until December 15, 2010, inclusive, shall include a separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in scope or cost to a degree determined by the Commissioner of Education once, and a separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in scope or cost to a degree determined by said commissioner twice. Any such listing submitted after December 15, 2010, until December 15, 2011, inclusive, shall include a separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in scope or cost to a degree determined by the Commissioner of Administrative Services once, and a separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in scope or cost to a degree determined by said commissioner twice. For the period beginning July 1, 2011, and ending December 31, 2013, each such listing shall include a report on the review conducted by the Commissioner of Education of the enrollment projections for each such eligible project. On and after January 1, 2014, each such listing shall include a report on the review conducted by the Commissioner of Administrative Services of the enrollment projections for each such eligible project. For the period beginning July 1, 2006, and ending June 30, 2012, no project, other than a project for a technical high school, may appear on the separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in cost more than twice. On and after July 1, 2012, no project, other than a project for a technical high school, may appear on the separate schedule of authorized projects which have changed in cost more than once, except the Commissioner of Administrative Services may allow a project to appear on such separate schedule of authorized projects a second time if the town or regional school district for such project can demonstrate that exigent circumstances require such project to appear a second time on such separate schedule of authorized projects. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, no projects which have changed in scope or cost to the degree determined by the Commissioner of Administrative Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, shall be eligible for reimbursement under this chapter unless it appears on such list. The percentage determined pursuant to section 10-285a at the time a school building project on such schedule was originally authorized shall be used for purposes of the grant for such project. On and after July 1, 2006, a project that was not previously authorized as an interdistrict magnet school shall not receive a higher percentage for reimbursement than that determined pursuant to section 10-285a at the time a school building project on such schedule was originally authorized. The General Assembly shall annually authorize the Commissioner of Administrative Services to enter into grant commitments on behalf of the state in accordance with the commissioner’s categorized listing for such projects as the General Assembly shall determine. The Commissioner of Administrative Services may not enter into any such grant commitments except pursuant to such legislative authorization. Any regional school district which assumes the responsibility for completion of a public school building project shall be eligible for a grant pursuant to subdivision (5) or (6), as the case may be, of subsection (a) of section 10-286 when such project is completed and accepted by such regional school district.

(3) (A) All final calculations completed by the Department of Administrative Services for school building projects shall include a computation of the state grant for the school building project amortized on a straight line basis over a twenty-year period for school building projects with costs equal to or greater than two million dollars and over a ten-year period for school building projects with costs less than two million dollars. Any town or regional school district which abandons, sells, leases, demolishes or otherwise redirects the use of such a school building project to other than a public school use during such amortization period shall refund to the state the unamortized balance of the state grant remaining as of the date the abandonment, sale, lease, demolition or redirection occurs. The amortization period for a project shall begin on the date the project was accepted as complete by the local or regional board of education. A town or regional school district required to make a refund to the state pursuant to this subdivision may request forgiveness of such refund if the building is redirected for public use. The Department of Administrative Services shall include as an addendum to the annual school construction priority list all those towns requesting forgiveness. General Assembly approval of the priority list containing such request shall constitute approval of such request. This subdivision shall not apply to projects to correct safety, health and other code violations or to remedy certified school indoor air quality emergencies approved pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or projects subject to the provisions of section 10-285c.

(B) Any moneys refunded to the state pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall be deposited in the state’s tax-exempt proceeds fund and used not later than sixty days after repayment to pay debt service on, including redemption, defeasance or purchase of, outstanding bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended.

(b) Notwithstanding the application date requirements of this section, the Commissioner of Administrative Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, may approve applications for grants to assist school building projects to remedy damage from fire and catastrophe, to correct safety, health and other code violations, to replace roofs, to remedy a certified school indoor air quality emergency, or to purchase and install portable classroom buildings at any time within the limit of available grant authorization and make payments thereon within the limit of appropriated funds, provided portable classroom building projects shall not create a new facility or cause an existing facility to be modified so that the portable buildings comprise a substantial percentage of the total facility area, as determined by the commissioner.

(c) No school building project shall be added to the list prepared by the Commissioner of Administrative Services pursuant to subsection (a) of this section after such list is submitted to the committee of the General Assembly appointed pursuant to section 10-283a unless (1) the project is for a school placed on probation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and the project is necessary to preserve accreditation, (2) the project is necessary to replace a school building for which a state agency issued a written notice of its intent to take the school property for public purpose, (3) it is a school building project determined by the Commissioner of Education to be a project that will assist the state in meeting the goals of the 2008 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al., as extended, or the goals of the 2013 stipulation and order for Milo Sheff, et al. v. William A. O’Neill, et al. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to projects previously authorized by the General Assembly that require special legislation to correct procedural deficiencies.

(d) No application for a school building project shall be accepted by the Commissioner of Education or the Commissioner of Administrative Services on or after July 1, 2002, unless the applicant has secured funding authorization for the local share of the project costs prior to application. The reimbursement percentage for a project covered by this subsection shall reflect the rates in effect during the fiscal year in which such local funding authorization is secured.

The ranking of each cooperative arrangement shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and each such cooperative arrangement shall receive the same reimbursement percentage as would a town with the same rank plus ten percentage points.

(e) If an elementary school building project for a new building or for the expansion of an existing building includes space for a school readiness program, the percentage determined pursuant to this section shall be increased by five percentage points, but shall not exceed one hundred per cent, for the portion of the building used primarily for such purpose. Recipient districts shall maintain full-day preschool enrollment for at least ten years.

(f) The percentage determined pursuant to this section for a school building project grant for the expansion, alteration or renovation of an existing public school building to convert such building for use as a lighthouse school, as defined in section 10-266cc, shall be increased by ten percentage points.

(h) Subject to the provisions of section 10-285d, if an elementary school building project for a school in a priority school district or for a priority school is necessary in order to offer a full-day kindergarten program or a full-day preschool program or to reduce class size pursuant to section 10-265f, the percentage determined pursuant to this section shall be increased by ten percentage points for the portion of the building used primarily for such full-day kindergarten program, full-day preschool program or such reduced size classes. Recipient districts that receive an increase pursuant to this subsection in support of a full-day preschool program, shall maintain full-day preschool enrollment for at least ten years.

(i) For all projects authorized on or after July 1, 2007, all attorneys’ fees and court costs related to litigation shall be eligible for state school construction grant assistance only if the grant applicant is the prevailing party in any such litigation.

#### Section 10-287: Installment payments of school building project grants. Construction contracts subject to bid. Withholding of state grant payments; conditions. Submission of final grant application.

(a) A grant for a school building project under this chapter to meet project costs not eligible for state financial assistance under section 10-287a shall be paid in installments, the number and time of payment of which shall correspond to the number and time of principal installment payments on municipal bonds, including principal payments to retire temporary notes renewed for the third and subsequent years pursuant to section 7-378a or 7-378e, issued for the purpose of financing such costs and shall be equal to the state’s share of project costs per principal installment on municipal bonds or notes, except in cases where the project has been fully paid for, in which case the number of installments shall be five or, in the case of a regional agricultural science and technology education center or a cooperative regional special educational facility, shall be one; provided final payment shall not be made prior to an audit conducted by the State Board of Education for each project for which a final calculation was not made prior to July 31, 1983. Grants under twenty-five thousand dollars shall be paid in one lump sum. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall certify to the State Comptroller, upon completion of the issuance of bonds or such renewal of temporary notes to finance each school building project, the dates and amounts of grant payments to be made pursuant to this chapter and the State Comptroller shall draw an order on the State Treasurer upon such certification to pay the amounts so certified when due. All site acquisition and project cost grant payments shall be made at least ten days prior to the principal payment on bonds or temporary notes related thereto or short-term financing issued to finance such site acquisition or project. Annual grant installments paid pursuant to this section on principal installment payments to retire temporary notes renewed pursuant to section 7-378a or 7-378e shall be based each year on the amount required to be retired pursuant to said sections, as adjusted for any ineligible project costs, and shall be paid only if at the time such temporary notes are renewed the rate of interest applicable to such notes is less than the rate of interest that would be applicable with respect to twenty-year bonds if issued at the time of such renewal. The determination related to such rates of interest pursuant to this subsection may be reviewed and shall be subject to approval by the Commissioner of Administrative Services prior to renewal of such notes. In the event that a school building project is not completed at the time bonds or temporary notes related thereto are issued to finance the project, the certification of the grant payments made pursuant to this section by the Commissioner of Administrative Services may be based on estimates, provided upon completion of such project and notification of final acceptance to the state, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall adjust and recertify the dates and amounts of subsequent grant payments based on the state’s share of final eligible costs.

(b) (1) All orders and contracts for school building construction receiving state assistance under this chapter, except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be awarded to the lowest responsible qualified bidder only after a public invitation to bid, which shall be advertised in a newspaper having circulation in the town in which construction is to take place, except for (A) school building projects for which the town or regional school district is using a state contract pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-292, and (B) change orders, those contracts or orders costing less than ten thousand dollars and those of an emergency nature, as determined by the Commissioner of Administrative Services, in which cases the contractor or vendor may be selected by negotiation, provided no local fiscal regulations, ordinances or charter provisions conflict.

(2) All orders and contracts for architectural or construction management services shall be awarded from a pool of not more than the four most responsible qualified proposers after a public selection process. Such process shall, at a minimum, involve requests for qualifications, followed by requests for proposals, including fees, from the proposers meeting the qualifications criteria of the request for qualifications process. Public advertisements shall be required in a newspaper having circulation in the town in which construction is to take place, except for school building projects for which the town or regional school district is using a state contract pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-292. Following the qualification process, the awarding authority shall evaluate the proposals to determine the four most responsible qualified proposers using those criteria previously listed in the requests for qualifications and requests for proposals for selecting architectural or construction management services specific to the project or school district. Such evaluation criteria shall include due consideration of the proposer’s pricing for the project, experience with work of similar size and scope as required for the order or contract, organizational and team structure for the order or contract, past performance data, including, but not limited to, adherence to project schedules and project budgets and the number of change orders for projects, the approach to the work required for the contract and documented contract oversight capabilities, and may include criteria specific to the project. Final selection by the awarding authority is limited to the pool of the four most responsible qualified proposers and shall include consideration of all criteria included within the request for proposals. As used in this subdivision, “most responsible qualified proposer” means the proposer who is qualified by the awarding authority when considering price and the factors necessary for faithful performance of the work based on the criteria and scope of work included in the request for proposals.

(c) If the commissioner determines that a building project has not met the approved conditions of the original application, the State Board of Education may withhold subsequent state grant payments for said project until appropriate action, as determined by the commissioner, is taken to cause the building project to be in compliance with the approved conditions or may require repayment of all state grant payments for said project when such appropriate action is not undertaken within a reasonable time.

(d) Each town or regional school district shall submit a final grant application to the Department of Administrative Services within one year from the date of completion and acceptance of the building project by the town or regional school district. If a town or regional school district fails to submit a final grant application within said period of time, the commissioner may withhold ten per cent of the state reimbursement for such project.

The substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond or note.

(f) A qualifying municipality may contract with the holders of any of the bonds or notes issued pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, as to the custody, collection, securing, investment and payment of any moneys of such a municipality derived in furtherance of the purposes of said sections and of any moneys held in a trust or otherwise for the payment of such bonds or notes, and carry out such contract. Moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or notes or in any way to secure bonds or notes and deposits of such moneys may be secured in the same manner as moneys of such a municipality. All banks and trust companies may give such security for such deposits. All moneys, securities and property received by such a municipality in trust for security of the bonds or notes issued pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, shall be kept separate from other funds and accounts of the municipality and shall be used for the purposes of said sections and for no other purpose.

(h) It is determined that the powers conferred on municipalities by sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, are in all respect for the benefit of the people of the state and for the improvement of their health, safety, welfare, comfort and security and that the purposes of said sections are public purposes and that municipalities will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by said sections. In consideration of the acceptance of any payment for bonds or notes issued by a municipality pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, the state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent holders and transferees of such bonds or notes that such bonds or notes and the income therefrom shall at all times be free from taxation, except for estate and gift taxes and taxes on transfers. Issuing municipalities are authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the holder of such bonds or notes.

(i) The state pledges to and agrees with the holders of any bonds or notes that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in a qualifying municipality to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with such holders, including agreements in any loan agreements, trust indentures or guaranty agreements, or in any way impair the rights and remedies of such holders until such bonds or notes, issued pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of such holders are fully met and discharged.

The board of selectmen or town council of the qualifying municipality may approve such guaranty agreement on behalf of such municipality. Each such guaranty shall constitute a general obligation of such qualifying municipality. If more than one qualifying municipality has entered into any such guaranty, each such municipality may, in the guaranty agreement, limit its obligation to an amount proportionate to the ratio of the number of students eligible for high school education from such municipality to the total number of students eligible for high school education from all municipalities which have entered such guaranties. Such guaranty obligations shall be reduced by the amount of moneys or securities held by the trustee for the bonds or notes in any fund for payment of such bonds or notes, including any grant payments received by the trustee pursuant to section 10-289g.

(k) No bonds or notes issued pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, nor any guaranty of such bonds or notes shall be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of any qualifying municipality nor be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness and borrowing capacity of any qualifying municipality.

(l) The validity of any bonds or notes or of any guaranty authorized by sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, may be contested only if an action, suit or proceeding contesting such validity is commenced within sixty days after the date of any referendum approval thereof.

#### Section 10-289g: Defaults in payment. Withholding of state aid.

The loan obligation of the private academy and the bonds or notes issued to finance such loan shall be secured by all school construction grants committed by the state to the private academy for the school building project. In the event of any default by the private academy under its loan agreement, the qualifying municipalities shall have the right to set off any tuition payments to the private academy to the extent of all loan payments due by the private academy under its loan agreement during each twelve-month period following such default and make such tuition payments directly to the trustee for the bonds or notes. Whenever it is established that a qualifying municipality or private academy has defaulted in the payment of the principal or redemption premium or interest on its bonds or notes or on any payment obligation due under any loan agreement authorized by sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, or any other event of default under any such loan agreement or guaranty agreement or the trust indenture for the bonds or notes occurs, the payment of state aid and assistance to such qualifying municipality or private academy pursuant to any statute in existence at the time the default is established shall be withheld by the state. If the trustee, on behalf of a holder or owner of any such bond or note or of such qualifying municipality or private academy, files with the State Comptroller a verified statement describing such default, the Comptroller may investigate the circumstances of the alleged default, prepare and file in his office a certificate setting forth his finding with respect to the default and serve a copy of such finding, by registered or certified mail, upon the treasurer or chief fiscal officer of each such qualifying municipality and the private academy and the indenture trustee. Upon the filing of such a verified statement in the office of the Comptroller, the Comptroller shall deduct and withhold from all succeeding payments of state aid or assistance otherwise due each such qualifying municipality or private academy such amounts as are necessary to pay the principal and redemption premium of and interest on such bonds and notes of such a qualifying municipality until such time as the indenture trustee files a verified statement with the Comptroller that all defaults have been cured. Payments of state aid or assistance so deducted and withheld shall be forwarded promptly by the Comptroller and the Treasurer to the paying agent or agents for the bonds and notes for the sole purpose of payment of principal and redemption premium of and interest on such bonds or notes. The Comptroller shall promptly notify the treasurer or the chief fiscal officer of each such qualifying municipality and the private academy of any payment or payments made to any paying agent or paying agents pursuant to this section. The state of Connecticut hereby covenants with the purchasers, holders and owners from time to time of bonds and notes issued by a qualifying municipality for school purposes that it will not repeal the provisions of this section or amend or modify the same so as to limit or impair the rights and remedies granted by this section, provided nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed as requiring the state to continue the payment of state aid or assistance to any qualifying municipality or private academy or as limiting or prohibiting the state from repealing or amending any law relating to state aid or assistance, the manner and time of payment or apportionment thereof or the amount thereof.

In any such case, the school district may pay off its debt on any such project over a period not to exceed four years if the school district promptly applies all interest subsidy grant payments toward interest costs on such debt as the same becomes due and payable and provides for the payment of such debt in equal annual installments commencing no later than one year from the date of issue.

The loan obligation of a private academy and the bonds or notes issued to finance such loan pursuant to sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, shall be secured by all interest subsidy grants committed by the state to the private academy in connection with such financing. Whenever it is established that a qualifying municipality or private academy has defaulted in the payment of the principal or redemption premium or interest on its bonds or notes or on any payment obligation due under any loan agreement authorized by said sections 10-289d to 10-289g, inclusive, or any other event of default under any such loan agreement or guaranty agreement or the trust indenture for the bonds or notes occurs, the payment of interest subsidy grants to such qualifying municipality or private academy pursuant to any provision of the general statutes in effect at the time the default is established shall be withheld by the state. If the trustee, on behalf of a holder or owner of any such bond or note or such qualifying municipality or private academy, files with the State Comptroller a verified statement describing such default, the State Comptroller may investigate the circumstances of the alleged default, prepare and file in his office a certificate setting forth his finding with respect to the default and serve a copy of such finding, by registered or certified mail, upon the State Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of each such qualifying municipality and the private academy and the indenture trustee. Upon the filing of such a verified statement in the office of the State Comptroller, the State Comptroller shall deduct and withhold from all succeeding interest subsidy grant payments otherwise due each such qualifying municipality or private academy such amounts as are necessary to pay the interest on such bonds and notes of such a qualifying municipality until such time as the indenture trustee files a verified statement with the State Comptroller that all defaults have been cured. Payments of interest subsidy grants so deducted and withheld shall be forwarded promptly by the State Comptroller and the State Treasurer to the paying agent or agents for the bonds and notes for the sole purpose of payment of interest on such bonds or notes. The State Comptroller shall promptly notify the State Treasurer or the chief fiscal officer of each such qualifying municipality and the private academy of any payment or payments made to any paying agent or paying agents pursuant to this section. The state of Connecticut hereby covenants with the purchasers, holders and owners, from time to time, of bonds and notes issued by a qualifying municipality for school purposes that it will not limit or impair the rights and remedies granted by this section, provided nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the state to continue the payment of state aid or assistance to any qualifying municipality or private academy or as limiting or prohibiting the state from repealing or amending any law relating to state aid or assistance, the manner and time of payment or apportionment thereof or the amount thereof.

#### Section 10-295: Specialized vision-related instruction, educational programs, goods and services. Expense of services. Teachers and educational resources; funding. Adult home instruction. Adaptive equipment.

(a) All residents of this state, regardless of age, who, because of blindness or impaired vision, require specialized vision-related educational programs, goods and services, on the signed recommendation of the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services, shall be entitled to receive such instruction, programs, goods and services for such length of time as is deemed expedient by said commissioner. Upon the petition of any parent or guardian of a blind child or a child with impaired vision, a local board of education may provide such instruction within the town or it may provide for such instruction by agreement with other towns as provided in subsection (d) of section 10-76d. All educational privileges prescribed in part V of chapter 164, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, shall apply to the pupils covered by this subsection.

(b) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall expend funds for the services made available pursuant to subsection (a) of this section from the educational aid for blind and visually handicapped children account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may adopt, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, such regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this subsection.

(1) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall provide, upon written request from any interested school district, the services of teachers of the visually impaired, based on the levels established in the individualized education or service plan. The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall also make available resources, including, but not limited to, the Braille and large print library, to all teachers of public and nonpublic school children. The commissioner may also provide vision-related professional development and training to all school districts and cover the actual cost for paraprofessionals from school districts to participate in agency-sponsored Braille training programs. The commissioner shall utilize education consultant positions, funded by moneys appropriated from the General Fund, to supplement new staffing that will be made available through the educational aid for the blind and visually handicapped children account, which shall be governed by formal written policies established by the commissioner.

(2) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall use funds appropriated to said account, first to provide specialized books, materials, equipment, supplies, adaptive technology services and devices, specialist examinations and aids, preschool programs and vision-related independent living services, excluding primary educational placement, for eligible children without regard to a per child statutory maximum.

(3) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may, within available appropriations, employ certified teachers of the visually impaired in sufficient numbers to meet the requests for services received from school districts. In responding to such requests, the commissioner shall utilize a formula for determining the number of teachers needed to serve the school districts, crediting six points for each Braille-learning child and one point for each other child, with one full-time certified teacher of the visually impaired assigned for every twenty-five points credited. The commissioner shall exercise due diligence to employ the needed number of certified teachers of the visually impaired, but shall not be liable for lack of resources. Funds appropriated to said account may also be utilized to employ rehabilitation teachers, rehabilitation technologists and orientation and mobility teachers in numbers sufficient to provide compensatory skills evaluations and training to blind and visually impaired children. In addition, up to five per cent of such appropriation may also be utilized to employ special assistants to the blind and other support staff necessary to ensure the efficient operation of service delivery. Not later than October first of each year, the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall determine the number of teachers needed based on the formula provided in this subdivision. Based on such determination, the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services shall estimate the funding needed to pay such teachers’ salaries, benefits and related expenses.

(4) In any fiscal year, when funds appropriated to cover the combined costs associated with providing the services set forth in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection are projected to be insufficient, the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may collect revenue from all school districts that have requested such services on a per student pro rata basis, in the sums necessary to cover the projected portion of these services for which there are insufficient appropriations.

(c) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may provide for the instruction of the adult blind in their homes, expending annually for this purpose such sums as the General Assembly may appropriate.

(d) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may expend up to ten thousand dollars per fiscal year per person twenty-one years of age or over who is both blind or visually impaired and deaf for the purpose of providing services through specialized public and private entities from which such person can benefit. The commissioner may determine the criteria by which a person is eligible to receive specialized services and may adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

(e) The Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may, within available appropriations, purchase adaptive equipment for persons receiving services pursuant to this chapter.

The tax credit voucher shall be in an amount equivalent to the lesser of the tax credit reserved upon certification of the rehabilitation plan under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section or (1) twenty-five per cent of the actual qualified rehabilitation expenditures, or (2) for projects including affordable housing pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, thirty per cent of the actual qualified rehabilitation expenditures.
